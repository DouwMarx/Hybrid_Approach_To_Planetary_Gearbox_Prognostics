   MEng Dissertation / PhD Thesis
   Department of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering

MEng Dissertations and PhD Thesis submissions must adhere to
specific formatting guidelines. This package includes a LaTeX class
file and template document based on the formatting guidelines.

The template requires a standard LaTeX installation such as MiTeX
under Windows, or TexLive under Linux. In the case of MiTeX additional
packages will need to be installed and this should happen
automatically. The additional packages include: fancyhdr, paralist,
titlesec and tocloft.

To create a dissertation or thesis using this template, edit the main
file diss_thesis.tex. The title page of the dissertation / thesis is
created automatically based on macros at the top of the
diss_thesis.tex file. These macros must be updated appropriately.
Note that the correct degree code must be specified as an option to
the dissertation / thesis class.

A standard Makefile is included that will generate the output PDF
file. A Windows TeXnicCenter project file is also included, although
the project may not be up to date.
