abstract = {Risk assessment performs a critical decision support role in maintenance decision making. This is through assisting maintenance practitioners systematically identify, analyze, evaluate and mitigate equipment failures. Often, such failures are mitigated through formulating effective maintenance strategies. In asset maintenance, well-known risk assessment techniques include the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), and Bayesian Networks (BN). In recent years, considerable research attention has been directed towards improving existing techniques, often at the expense of a structured framework for selecting suitable risk assessment techniques. Often, several criteria influence the selection process. Moreover, the criteria are closely linked to specific organizational competencies that vary from one firm to another. In this study, a selection methodology for risk assessment techniques in the maintenance decision making domain is proposed. In the methodology, generic selection criteria for the FMEA, FTA and BN are derived based on the risk assessment process outlined in the ISO 31000:2009 standard. The criteria are prioritized using the Analytic Network Process (ANP), taking into account the judgment and opinion of academic and industrial domain experts. The results illustrate the usefulness of the proposed methodology towards assisting maintenance practitioners discern important competencies relevant to the specific technique and as such select the technique best suited for the organization.},

Fire models and information systems have greatly influenced fuel assessment methods, As an example, we examine the evolution of technology used to put Rothermel's fire spread model into application. A review of fire and fuel modeling terminology is given, and the relationship between fire models and fuel models is explained. We review current fire modeling work and the influence that it will have on fuel characterization.

abstract = {The power spectrum is defined as the square of the magnitude of the Fourier transform (FT) of a signal. The advantage of FT analysis is that it allows the decomposition of a signal into individual periodic frequency components and establishes the relative intensity of each component. It is the most commonly used signal processing technique today. If the same principle is applied for the detection of periodicity components in a Fourier spectrum, the process is called the cepstrum analysis. Cepstrum analysis is a very useful tool for detection families of harmonics with uniform spacing or the families of sidebands commonly found in gearbox, bearing and engine vibration fault spectra. Higher order spectra (HOS) (also known as polyspectra) consist of higher order moment of spectra which are able to detect non-linear interactions between frequency components. For HOS, the most commonly used is the bispectrum. The bispectrum is the third-order frequency domain measure, which contains information that standard power spectral analysis techniques cannot provide. It is well known that neural networks can represent complex non-linear relationships, and therefore they are extremely useful for fault identification and classification. This paper presents an application of power spectrum, cepstrum, bispectrum and neural network for fault pattern extraction of induction motors. The potential for using the power spectrum, cepstrum, bispectrum and neural network as a means for differentiating between healthy and faulty induction motor operation is examined. A series of experiments is done and the advantages and disadvantages between them are discussed. It has been found that a combination of power spectrum, cepstrum and bispectrum plus neural network analyses could be a very useful tool for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of induction motors. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Performance assessment was carried out with the three procedures in static TE calculation of a helical gear pair under load with global tooth contact analysis. The procedures were compared in terms of computational effort to solve the load distribution problem and the accuracy of the solution. An incremental procedure with gradual and iterative load application was assessed for solving the full load distribution problem and calculating TE. Then the full load distribution problem was replaced by a reduced, but equivalent, problem through a method called pseudo-interference. The reduced problem was solved using the other two proposed procedures, a linear programming solution based on an interior-point algorithm and a direct matrix solver based on Cholesky factorisation. This latter procedure showed to be highly efficient in solving load distribution problems of gear teeth. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper, a method based on the finite element vibration analysis is presented for defect detection in rolling element bearings with single or multiple defects on different components of the bearing structure using the time and frequency domain parameters. A dynamic loading model is proposed in order to create the nodal excitation functions used in the finite element vibration analysis as external loading. A computer code written in Visual Basic programming language with a graphical user interface is developed to create the nodal excitations for different cases including the outer ring, inner ring or rolling element defects. Forced vibration analysis of a bearing structure is performed using the commercial finite element package I-DEAS under the action of an unbalanced force transferred to the structure via a ball bearing. Time and frequency domain parameters such as rms, crest factor, kurtosis and band energy ratio for the frequency spectrum of the enveloped signals are used to analyse the effect of the defect location and the number of defects on the time and frequency domain parameters. The role of the receiving point for vibration measurements is also investigated. The vibration data for various defect cases including the housing structure effect can be obtained using the finite element vibration analysis in order to develop an optimum monitoring method in condition monitoring studies. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Prognostics technique aims to accurately estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a subsystem or a component using sensor data, which has many real world applications. However, many of the existing algorithms are based on linear models, which cannot capture the complex relationship between the sensor data and RUL. Although Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) has been applied to predict RUL, it cannot learn salient features automatically, because of its network structure. A novel deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based regression approach for estimating the RUL is proposed in this paper. Although CNN has been applied on tasks such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition etc., this is the first attempt to adopt CNN for RUL estimation in prognostics. Different from the existing CNN structure for computer vision, the convolution and pooling filters in our approach are applied along the temporal dimension over the multi-channel sensor data to incorporate automated feature learning from raw sensor signals in a systematic way. Through the deep architecture, the learned features are the higher-level abstract representation of low-level raw sensor signals. Furthermore, feature learning and RUL estimation are mutually enhanced by the supervised feedback. We compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms on two publicly available data sets to evaluate the effectiveness of this proposed approach. The encouraging results demonstrate that our proposed deep convolutional neural network based regression approach for RUL estimation is not only more efficient but also more accurate. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract = {This paper concerns the use of neural networks for predicting the residual life of machines and components. In addition, the advantage of using condition-monitoring data to enhance the predictive capability of these neural networks was also investigated. A number of neural network variations were trained and tested with the data of two different reliability-related datasets. The first dataset represents the renewal case where the failed unit is repaired and restored to a good-as-new condition. Data were collected in the laboratory by subjecting a series of similar test pieces to fatigue loading with a hydraulic actuator. The average prediction error of the various neural networks being compared varied from 431 to 841 s on this dataset, where test pieces had a characteristic life of 8971 s. The second dataset were collected from a group of pumps used to circulate a water and magnetite solution within a plant. The data therefore originated from a repaired system affected by reliability degradation. When optimized, the multi-layer perceptron neural networks trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and the general regression neural network produced a sum-of-squares error within 11.1{\%} of each other for the renewal dataset. The small number of inputs and poorly mapped input space on the second dataset meant that much larger errors were recorded on some of the test data. The potential for using neural networks for residual life prediction and the advantage of incorporating condition-based data into the model was nevertheless proven for both examples. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Polymer composite rotors are lightweight and offer great perspectives in high-speed applications such as turbo machinery. Currently, novel rotor structures and materials are investigated for the purpose of increasing machine efficiency and lifetime, as well as allowing for higher dynamic loads. However, due to the complexity of the composite materials an in-process measurement system is required. This allows for monitoring the evolution of damages under dynamic loads, for testing and predicting the structural integrity of composite rotors in process. In rotor design, it can be used for calibrating and improving models, simulating the dynamic behaviour of polymer composite rotors. The measurement system is to work non-invasive, offer micron uncertainty, as well as a high measurement rate of several tens of kHz. Furthermore, it must be applicable at high surface speeds and under technical vacuum. In order to fulfil these demands a novel laser distance measurement system was developed. It provides the angle resolved measurement of the biaxial deformation of a fibre-reinforced polymer composite rotor with micron uncertainty at surface speeds of more than 300 m/s. Furthermore, a simulation procedure combining a finite element model and a damage mechanics model is applied. A comparison of the measured data and the numerically calculated data is performed to validate the simulation towards rotor expansion. This validating procedure can be used for a model calibration in the future. The simulation procedure could be used to investigate different damage-test cases of the rotor, in order to define its structural behaviour without further experiments.},

abstract = {Time series clustering has been shown effective in providing useful information in various domains. There seems to be an increased interest in time series clustering as part of the effort in temporal data mining research. To provide an overview, this paper surveys and summarizes previous works that investigated the clustering of time series data in various application domains. The basics of time series clustering are presented, including general-purpose clustering algorithms commonly used in time series clustering studies, the criteria for evaluating the performance of the clustering results, and the measures to determine the similarity/dissimilarity between two time series being compared, either in the forms of raw data, extracted features, or some model parameters. The past researchs are organized into three groups depending upon whether they work directly with the raw data either in the time or frequency domain, indirectly with features extracted from the raw data, or indirectly with models built from the raw data. The uniqueness and limitation of previous research are discussed and several possible topics for future research are identified. Moreover, the areas that time series clustering have been applied to are also summarized, including the sources of data used. It is hoped that this review will serve as the steppingstone for those interested in advancing this area of research. {\textcopyright} 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper extends the proposed bearing matrix formulation of Parts I and II to analyze the overall dynamics of a geared rotor system which includes a spur gear pair, shafts, rolling element bearing, a prime mover and a load (attached to the geared rotor system through flexible torsional couplings), a rigid or flexible casing, and compliant or massive mounts. Linear time-invariant, discrete dynamic models of a generic geared rotor system with proportional viscous damping are developed, by using lumped parameter and dynamic finite element techniques, which are then used to predict the vibration transmissibility through bearings and mounts, casing vibration motion, and dynamic response of the internal rotating system. Each rotating shaft is modeled as an Euler beam in the lumped parameter model and as a Timoshenko beam in the dynamic finite element model, but the gyroscopic moment is not included. Eigensolution and forced harmonic response studies due to rotating mass unbalance or kinematic transmission error excitation for the following example cases are obtained by using the formulation, and the results are compared with those of simple models currently available in the literature and/or experiment: case I, a single-stage rotor system with flexibly mounted rigid casing consisting of two bearings as a special case of the geared rotor system; case II, a spur gear pair drive supported by four bearings installed in a flexibly mounted rigid casing; and case III, an experimental set-up consisting of a high-precision gear and pinion, and four identical rolling element bearings contained in a flexible casing mounted rigidly on a massive foundation. Analytical predictions show that the theory is indeed capable of predicting bearing and mount moment transmissibilities in addition to the force transmissibilities. Also, flexural vibrations of the casing plate are predicted well as the theory is in good agreement with measurements made on case III; such predictions are not provided by simple models due to inadequate bearing formulation. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {Fault diagnosis is essentially a kind of pattern recognition. How to implement feature extraction and improve recognition performance is a crucial task. In this paper, a new supervised manifold learning algorithm (S-LapEig) for feature extraction is proposed first. Via combining preserving the consistency of local neighbor information and class labels information, S-LapEig can not only gain a perfect approximation of low-dimensional intrinsic geometric structure within the high-dimensional observation data, but also enhance local within-class relations. Based on S-LapEig, a novel fault diagnosis approach is proposed. The approach extracts the intrinsic manifold features from high-dimensional fault data by directly learning the data, and translates complex mode space into a low-dimensional feature space, in which pattern classification and fault diagnosis are carried out easily. Comparing with other feature extraction methods such as PCA, LDA and Laplacian eigenmaps, the proposed method obviously improves the classification performance of fault pattern recognition. The experiments on benchmark data and engineering instance demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the new approach. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Rolling element bearings are widely used in various industrial machines, such as electric motors, generators, pumps, gearboxes, railway axles, turbines, and helicopter transmissions. Fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings is beneficial to preventing any unexpected accident and reducing economic loss. In the past years, many bearing fault detection methods have been developed. Recently, a new adaptive signal processing method called empirical wavelet transform attracts much attention from readers and engineers and its applications to bearing fault diagnosis have been reported. The main problem of empirical wavelet transform is that Fourier segments required in empirical wavelet transform are strongly dependent on the local maxima of the amplitudes of the Fourier spectrum of a signal, which connotes that Fourier segments are not always reliable and effective if the Fourier spectrum of the signal is complicated and overwhelmed by heavy noises and other strong vibration components. In this paper, sparsity guided empirical wavelet transform is proposed to automatically establish Fourier segments required in empirical wavelet transform for fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings. Industrial bearing fault signals caused by single and multiple railway axle bearing defects are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed sparsity guided empirical wavelet transform. Results show that the proposed method can automatically discover Fourier segments required in empirical wavelet transform and reveal single and multiple railway axle bearing defects. Besides, some comparisons with three popular signal processing methods including ensemble empirical mode decomposition, the fast kurtogram and the fast spectral correlation are conducted to highlight the superiority of the proposed method.},

abstract = {The remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of rolling element bearings has attracted substantial attention recently due to its importance for the bearing health management. The exponential model is one of the most widely used methods for RUL prediction of rolling element bearings. However, two shortcomings exist in the exponential model: 1) the first predicting time (FPT) is selected subjectively; and 2) random errors of the stochastic process decrease the prediction accuracy. To deal with these two shortcomings, an improved exponential model is proposed in this paper. In the improved model, an adaptive FPT selection approach is established based on the 3 sigma interval, and particle filtering is utilized to reduce random errors of the stochastic process. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the improved model, a simulation and four tests of bearing degradation processes are utilized for the RUL prediction. The results show that the improved model is able to select an appropriate FPT and reduce random errors of the stochastic process. Consequently, it performs better in the RUL prediction of rolling element bearings than the original exponential model.},

To support this role, the development of the communication and information technologies has allowed the emergence of the concept of e-maintenance.

As we will discuss later in this paper, e-maintenance integrates existing telemaintenance principles, with Web services and modern e-collaboration principles. Collaboration allows to share and exchange not only information but also knowledge and (e)-intelligence. By means of a collaborative environment, pertinent knowledge and intelligence become available and usable at the right place and time, in order to facilitate reaching the best maintenance decisions.

The FEA models developed for calculation of the torsional stiffness and tooth load sharing ratio of the gears in mesh with the spalling and crack damage are also described. The dynamic simulation results of vibration from the gearbox were obtained by using Matlab and Simulink models, which were developed from the equations of motion. The simulation results were found to be consistent with results from previously published mathematical analysis and experimental investigations. The difference and comparison between the vibration signals with the tooth crack and spalling damage are discussed by investigating some of the common diagnostic functions and changes to the frequency spectra results.

abstract = {Information about the dynamic loading of a steel structure is important for its static design as well as for an assessment of its fatigue life. In the case of tower cranes, these loads are mainly caused by vibrations and load sway, which occurs as a result of the slewing motion of the jib around the vertical axis and from the radial movement of the load's suspension point. In this paper, only the slewing motion that produces the spatial motion of the pendulum is considered, because this kind of motion has received much less attention than the translation of the suspension point. In order to achieve this, a non-linear mathematical model of the load sway during the slewing motion was formulated, and the non-linear nature of the swinging motion for large angles and the non-linearity of the power transmission were considered. The structure's elasticity and damping, the friction in the main bearing, and the air resistance were also taken into account. The dynamic forces acting on the steel structure of the crane during payload transport were obtained. In order to confirm the mathematical model, an actual model of a crane was built and used as the basis for measurements. A comparison of the results shows good agreement between the predicted and the measured values. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

These trends, however, often reveal considerable irregularities, or fluctuations, which cannot be attributed to technical condition evolution. They can render diagnostic reasoning vague and uncertain. This results from the fact that symptom values are influenced not only by object condition parameters, but also by a number of other factors, which sometimes are dominant. More detailed analysis leads to a conclusion that a measure of symptom value fluctuations can itself be used as a diagnostic symptom. This conclusion is supported by the model-based consideration, employing a modification of the Energy Processor (EP) model, developed specifically for this purpose. To illustrate this special feature, several examples are presented and discussed, employing databases obtained for large steam turbines. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents a damage detection technique based on operational response monitoring. The technique utilizes finite element and linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) analyses. The main novel feature of this technique is its ability to identify structural damage completely. The technique is based on monitoring the changes in internal data variability measured by a test statistic $\chi$02 value. Structural normality is assumed when the $\chi$0 m2 value calculated from a fresh set of measured data falls inside the limits prescribed by a threshold value $\chi$0 TH2. The extent of damage is quantified by matching the $\chi$0 m2 value calculated from the measured data with the corresponding $\chi$0 p2 values predicted by using a benchmark finite element model. The use of $\chi$02 values has been found to provide better sensitivity to structural damage than the natural frequency shift technique. The findings are illustrated in the case of a numerical case study of a simulated steel cantilever beam and an experimental cantilever beam. The analysis done on the numerical study showed that the sensitivity of the proposed technique ranged from three to 1000 times as much as the sensitivity of the natural frequencies. The results obtained from a laboratory structure showed that the extent of damage and the remaining service life could be accurately assessed up to a crack size corresponding to 0.55 of the material's thickness. It was observed that this crack size corresponded to the limiting crack size for the applicability of linear elastic fracture mechanics theory. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Propagating cracked rotor vibrations may contain substantial information on the rotor crack conditions. Capturing the characteristic vibrations due to the non-stationary response of rotors of which the speed change, is useful for condition monitoring of such systems. From the literature it is clear that vibrations at harmonics of the rotational speed, as well as transient responses, may be considered key indicators of cracks in rotors. Since faults other than cracks, such as misalignment and imbalance also generate harmonic vibrations, the non-order related vibrations therefore become important characteristics in detecting cracked rotor problems. But these signals may present with small amplitude and may easily be missed among the non-stationary harmonic vibrations. Therefore, clear identification of harmonic as well as non-order related (transient) vibrations are both important for detecting cracks in rotor systems. In this paper, a finite element model is used to calculate the response of a rotor with a propagating transverse crack under varying rotational speed conditions. various order tracking techniques, i.e. computed order tracking, Vold-Kalman filter order tracking, Gabor order tracking, are implemented to remove the varying speed harmonic vibrations so that the non-order related vibrations in which information about the cracks are contained, are emphasized. And some other signal processing methods that may achieve similar effects, i.e. double re-sampling method and intrinsic mode function from empirical mode decomposition, are also discussed for comparisons to these order tracking techniques. The paper demonstrates the advantages of order tracking methods in rotor crack detection. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {When an incipient fault develops, rolling-element bearing produces stochastic cyclostationary vibrations. In practice, this symptomatic property is usually masked by second vibration sources that contain cyclostationary deterministic components produced by neighboring operating gears. In the case of stationary speed conditions, the synchronous average has proven its usefulness for estimating the signal mean, thus separating these two sources. Once separated, the mean instantaneous power can be estimated by the synchronous average applied to the envelope of the residual signal. This tool proves efficient for extracting bearing fault contribution. However, in speed varying conditions, the cyclostationary nature of the vibration signal turns to become cyclo-non-stationary. This leads to an inaccurate estimation of the gear deterministic vibration part and the bearing fault vibration, which results in misleading diagnosis features. This paper aims at proposing a new procedure of estimating the synchronous average under high and random speed variations in order to efficiently (i) separate deterministic and random sources, and (ii) relax the mean instantaneous power. Being based on a structured discretization of the speed profile, this method is able to track the amplitude and the phase variations imposed by the speed changes. Successful examples are then demonstrated on simulated and actual vibration data measured from a test-rig operating in run-up regime.},

Included are the reasons and justification behind the adoption of any of the techniques presented. The motivation behind the decision making in regard to various applications is both financial and technical. Both of these aspects are discussed, with the emphasis being on the technical side. The chapter defines machinery failure (causes, types, and frequency), and describes basic maintenance strategies and the factors that should be considered when deciding which to apply in a given situation. Topics considered in detail include transducer selection and mounting location, recording and analysis instrumentation, and display formats and analysis tools (specifically, time domain, frequency domain, modal domain, and quefrency domain-based strategies). The discussion of fault detection is based primarily on standards and acceptance limits in the time and frequency domains. The discussion of fault diagnostics is divided into sections that focus on different forcing functions, specific machine components, specific machine types, and advanced diagnostic techniques. Further considerations on this topic are found in Chapter 26 and Chapter 27.},

abstract = {A new technique, the instantaneous wavelet bicoherence (WB) is proposed and investigated. The use of the instantaneous and locally averaged WB from vibration measurements for local damage detection in gears is investigated for the first time; these bicoherences are better adapted than the classical Fourier bicoherence to the case of non-stationary signals. A new diagnostic feature based on the integrated modulus of the WB in a specific frequency range and a methodology for feature estimation are proposed. The WB techniques are applied to detection of a multiple like natural pitting on a back-to-back industrial spur gearbox system and natural pitting on a gear at test rig and show the possibility of early detection of local tooth faults. The detection effectiveness is evaluated by a local Fisher criterion estimated at each angular position of gear for the unpitted and pitted cases. The proposed WB-based diagnostic feature demonstrates robust experimental performance and superior detection capabilities (i.e., effective early damage detection differentially for teeth of the gear wheel) over the conventional detection methods based on the wavelet transform. The reason for this superior effectiveness is that the WB exploits the phase couplings of the wavelet transform at different frequencies, which contain useful additional information for detection of non-linear phenomena induced by local faults. The proposed approaches are compared with the two conventional approaches based on the wavelet transform. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Guided ultrasonic wave testing of the defects associated with resinanchored rock bolts was investigated. Axisymmetrical and threedimensional finite element models were built, one of a partially encapsulated bolt and the other of a bolt with a simulated local corrosion crack. Experimental bolts were then installed in a testing block and typical responses were compared to finite element models of different defect scenarios. Encouraging results were obtained for the smaller axisymmetrical and three-dimensional finite element models, as well as during the experimental investigation. It is recommended that software with energy-absorbing elements should be utilized to consider higher frequencies and longer bolts. Once the integrity of models such as these has been established, the models could in principle be used to train neural networks for use in commercial equipment to determine the integrity of the installed bolt.},

abstract = {Objectives: The goal of this session is to understand the association between resilience and mental illness and identify a school-based intervention to enhance resilience in at risk youth living in urban low-income neighborhoods, with significant community violence. Colombia's armed conflict has led to widespread violence and forced displacement of people to marginalized neighborhoods surrounding major cities in which children are victims of both the armed conflict and community violence, with no access to mental health services. Building resilience in childhood may reduce psychopathology, particularly in at risk populations and in resource-poor environments such as the ones observed in this study. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of resilience and psychopathology in school children (ages 12-18 years) attending five public schools in low-income marginalized neighborhoods, with significant community violence in Bogot{\'{a}}. Over 500 adolescents completed self-report questionnaires on resilience, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse. We also conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify school-based interventions aimed at enhancing psychological resilience to identify, adapt, and implement an effective evidence-based intervention. Results: Pairwise correlations of the measures showed statistically significant negative correlations between our resilience measure and all clinical measures as follows: resilience and anxiety (r=-0.29, P {\textless} 0.0001); resilience and depression (r= -0.69, P {\textless} 0.0001); and resilience and substance abuse (r= -0.32, P {\textless} 0.0001). The systematic review identified 17 school-based interventions in different settings around the world. Although study designs had varied in rigor, some studies indicated promising results in enhancing resilience with effect sizes ranging from 0.05 to 0.50. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that higher resilience scores are associated with lower anxiety and depression symptoms and less substance abuse. We also identified several school-based, resilience-building interventions that can be delivered in low-income settings. These data highlight the value of resilience as an area of focus for preventive interventions in mental health and the need for randomized controlled trials to assess efficacy, which our team is actively developing.},

abstract = {Condition-based maintenance is an emerging paradigm of modern system health monitoring, where maintenance operations are based on diagnostics and prognostics. Condition-based maintenance strategies in the industry benefit from accurate predictions of the remaining useful life (RUL) of an asset in order to optimise maintenance scheduling, resources and supply chain management. Due to the substantial costs involved, small improvements in efficiency, result in the significant cost reductions for overall maintenance services as well as its impact on energy consumption and the environment. In this paper, we present a data-driven methodology combining the hierarchical Bayesian data modelling techniques with an information-theoretic direct density ratio based change point detection algorithm to address two very generic issues namely dealing with irregular events and dealing with recoverable degradation, which are often encountered in the prognosis of complex systems such as the modern gas turbine engines. Its performance is compared with that of an existing Bayesian Hierarchical Model technique and is found to be superior in typical (heterogeneous) and non-typical scenarios. First, the technique is illustrated by an example on the simulation data and later on, it is also validated on the real-world civil aerospace gas turbine fleet data.},

abstract = {Health condition monitoring of rotating machinery is a crucial task to guarantee reliability in industrial processes. In particular, bearings are mechanical components used in most rotating devices and they represent the main source of faults in such equipments; reason for which research activities on detecting and diagnosing their faults have increased. Fault detection aims at identifying whether the device is or not in a fault condition, and diagnosis is commonly oriented towards identifying the fault mode of the device, after detection. An important step after fault detection and diagnosis is the analysis of the magnitude or the degradation level of the fault, because this represents a support to the decision-making process in condition based-maintenance. However, no extensive works are devoted to analyse this problem, or some works tackle it from the fault diagnosis point of view. In a rough manner, fault severity is associated with the magnitude of the fault. In bearings, fault severity can be related to the physical size of fault or a general degradation of the component. Due to literature regarding the severity assessment of bearing damages is limited, this paper aims at discussing the recent methods and techniques used to achieve the fault severity evaluation in the main components of the rolling bearings, such as inner race, outer race, and ball. The review is mainly focused on data-driven approaches such as signal processing for extracting the proper fault signatures associated with the damage degradation, and learning approaches that are used to identify degradation patterns with regards to health conditions. Finally, new challenges are highlighted in order to develop new contributions in this field.},

However, it may be difficult in some cases to mount an appropriate monitoring device to obtain reliable speed information. In this paper, a novel empirical re-sampling of intrinsic mode functions obtained from empirical mode decomposition is explored, so that the approximation of order tracking effects without rotational speed is possible. The newly introduced intrinsic cycle concept in the intrinsic mode function simplifies linking of the resultant spectra to signal variations, and is therefore beneficial for condition monitoring of rotating machines. In the paper the rationale behind the technique is first explained. Secondly, the effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated on a dynamic gear simulation model. Lastly, the technique is applied to experimental data from a gearbox test rig. Both the simulation and experimental studies corroborate the usefulness of the proposed technique. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Bearings are common and vital elements in rotating machinery. By tracking the condition of a bearing, unscheduled machinery outages and costly damage caused by a bearing failure can be avoided. In this paper, we developed a new scheme based on wavelet packet decomposition and hidden Markov modeling (HMM) for tracking the severity of bearing faults. In this scheme, vibration signals were decomposed into wavelet packets and the node energies of the decomposition tree were used as features. Based on the features extracted from normal bearing vibration signals, an HMM was trained to model the normal bearing operating condition. The probabilities of this HMM were then used to track the condition of the bearing. Experimental data collected from a bearing accelerated life test showed that unlike many of the other commonly used trend parameters whose distinguishing features diminished to normal bearing-like levels as the damage grew, the probabilities of the normal bearing HMM kept decreasing as the bearing damage progressed toward bearing failure. As the bearing approached the end of its life (10{\%} of remaining life), the HMM probabilities dropped dramatically signaling severe damage and imminent bearing failure. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Energy, and particularly electricity, has played and will continue to play a very important role in the development of human society. Electricity, which is the most flexible and manageable energy form, is currently used in a variety of activities and applications. For instance, electricity is used for heating, cooling, lighting, and for operating electronic appliances and electric vehicles. Nowadays, given the rapid development and commercialization of technologies and devices that rely on electricity, electricity demand is increasing faster than overall primary energy supply. Consequently, the design and planning of power systems is becoming a progressively more important issue in order to provide affordable, reliable and sustainable energy in timely fashion, not only in developed countries but particularly in developing economies where electricity demand is increasing even faster.Power systems are networks of electrical devices, such as power plants, transformers, and transmission lines, used to produce, transmit, and supply electricity. The design and planning of such systems require the selection of generation technologies, along with the capacity, location, and timing of generation and transmission capacity expansions to meet electricity demand over a long-term horizon. This manuscript presents a comprehensive optimization framework for the design and planning of interconnected power systems, including the integration of generation and transmission capacity expansion planning. The proposed framework also considers renewable energies, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies, demand-side management (DSM), as well as reserve and CO2 emission constraints. The novelty of this framework relies on an integrated assessment of the aforementioned features, which can reveal possible interactions and synergies within the power system. Moreover, the capabilities of the proposed framework are demonstrated using a suite of case studies inspired by a real-world power system, including "business as usual" and "CO2 mitigation policy" scenarios. These case studies illustrated the adaptability and effectiveness of the framework at dealing with typical situations that can arise in designing and planning power systems.},

Bearing failure leads to failure of a machine and unpredicted productivity loss for production facilities. Hence, bearing fault detection and diagnosis is an integral part of the preventive maintenance procedures. In this paper vibration signals for three conditions of a deep groove ball bearing Normal (N), defect on inner race (IR) and defect on outer race (OR) were acquired from a customized bearing test rig, under one load and two speed conditions. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) has been used for vibration signal analysis. The statistical features extracted from the dominant wavelet coefficients are used as inputs to ANN classifier to evaluate its performance. The vibration signals have also been denoised using a new thresholding scheme. A comparison of ANN performance is made based on raw vibration data and denoised data. The ANN performance has been found to be comparatively higher when denoised signals were used as inputs to the classifier. Also various mother wavelet functions (Db8, Db4, Db44 and Sym10) were used to analyze the denoised vibration signals and their performance has been evaluated using the ANN classifiers. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

It will devastate the working performance of the gear system, by problems such as vibration and noise, or even lead to a broken tooth, which will stop the normal working process of the gear system. It has attracted wide attention from researchers. However, the previous studies focused their concentration only on the mesh stiffness reduction due to tooth root crack, while the tooth plastic inclination due to tooth bending damages like gear tooth root crack is seldom considered. In this paper, a tooth plastic inclination model for spur gear with tooth root crack is developed by regarding the cracked tooth as a cantilever beam. It influences not only the displacement excitation but also the mesh stiffness and load-sharing factor among tooth pairs in mesh. The simulation results obtained by incorporating the tooth plastic inclination deformation model together with the tooth root crack model into a 21-Degree-of-Freedom planetary gear dynamic model indicate that the tooth plastic inclination has a significant effect on the performance of the gear system rather than the mesh stiffness reduction due to tooth root crack.},

abstract = {Current haul road management techniques, such as routine, periodic and urgent maintenance have shortcomings in many complex haul road environments. Real-time road condition monitoring may significantly reduce maintenance costs, both to the road and to the vehicles. A recent idea is that vehicle on-board data collection systems could be used to monitor haul roads on a real-time basis by means of vibration signature analysis. This paper proposes a methodology based on Bayesian regression to isolate the effect of varying vehicle speed on the measured vehicle response metric. A key feature of the proposed methodology is that it avoids the costly need to generate analytical or empirical vehicle models. {\textcopyright} 2011 ISTVS. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Varying load can cause changes in a measured gearbox vibration signal. However, conventional techniques for fault diagnosis are based on the assumption that changes in vibration signal are only caused by deterioration of the gearbox. There is a need to develop a technique to provide accurate state indicator of gearbox under fluctuating load conditions. This paper presents an approach to gear fault diagnosis based on complex Morlet continuous wavelet transform under this condition. Gear motion residual signal, which represents the departure of time synchronously averaged signal from the average tooth-meshing vibration, is analyzed as source data due to its lower sensitiveness to the alternating load condition. A fault growth parameter based on the amplitude of wavelet transform is proposed to evaluate gear fault advancement quantitatively. We found that this parameter is insensitive to varying load and can correctly indicate early gear fault. For a comparison, the advantages and disadvantages of other measures such as kurtosis, mean, variance, form factor and crest factor, both of residual signal and mean amplitude of continuous wavelet transform waveform, are also discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed fault indicator is demonstrated using a full lifetime vibration data history obtained under sinusoidal varying load. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Using condition monitoring to track machine health and trigger maintenance actions is a proven best practice. By monitoring machinery health, costly failures are avoided and downtime due to outages is reduced, which finally results in an increase of operational efficiency and productivity of the equipment. Many papers discuss the implementation of condition monitoring to prevent failures and optimize maintenance actions. However, much less attention is paid to the use of condition monitoring information in order to optimize production capacity of a machine or a plant. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to establish the link between condition monitoring information and production capacity optimization by continuously adjusting production parameters (e.g. production speed) according to the measured condition monitoring information. In this paper condition monitoring of steel production machines using cost-effective temperature sensors is applied to monitor possible overheating of the machine and used to optimize the machine's speed. Without optimization, the machine is simply stopped when overheating is detected. This results on lost production capacity. Therefore, the condition monitoring information is used as an input to the machine's controller in order to optimize the production speed. The speed of the production machine is namely directly related to the corresponding temperature increase or decrease. Optimization of the production speed results in maximal production capacity and minimal machine downtime by prevention of overheating. The paper clearly illustrates how temperature condition monitoring information can be used to maximize industrial production capacity. This approach extends the use of condition monitoring information from purely avoiding unexpected failures to productivity optimization of an entire system.},

abstract = {In complex industrial system, most of single faults have multiple propagation paths, so any local slight deviation is able to propagate, spread, accumulate and increase through system fault causal chains. It will finally result in unplanned outages and even catastrophic accidents, which lead to huge economic losses, environmental contamination, or human injuries. In order to ensure system intrinsic safety and increase operational performance and reliability in a long period, this study proposes an integrated safety prognosis model (ISPM) considering the randomness, complexity and uncertainty of fault propagation. ISPM is developed based on dynamic Bayesian networks to model the propagation of faults in a complex system, integrating the priori knowledge of the interactions and dependencies among subsystems, components, and the environment of the system, as well as the relationships between fault causes and effects. So the current safety state and potential risk of system can be assessed by locating potential hazard origins and deducing corresponding possible consequences. Furthermore, ISPM is also developed to predict the future degradation trend in terms of future reliability or performance of system, and provide proper proactive maintenance plans. Ant colony algorithm is introduced in ISPM by comprehensively considering two factors as probability and severity of faults, to perform the quantitative risk estimation of the underlining system. The feasibility and benefits of ISPM are investigated with a field case study of gas turbine compressor system. According to the outputs given by ISPM in the application, proactive maintenance, safety-related actions and contingency plans are further discussed and then made to keep the system in a high reliability and safety level in the long term. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal was to determine whether cracks grew through gear teeth or through gear rims for various rim thicknesses. A finite element based computer program (FRANC, FRacture ANalysis Code) simulated gear tooth crack propagation. The analysis used principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics. Quarter-point, triangular elements were used at the crack tip to represent the stress singularity. The program had an automated crack propagation option in which cracks were grown numerically using an automated re-meshing scheme. Crack tip stress intensity factors were estimated to determine crack propagation direction. Gears with various backup ratios (rim thickness divided by tooth height) were tested to validate crack path predictions. Gear bending fatigue tests were performed in a spur gear fatigue rig. From both predictions and tests, gears with backup ratios of 3.3 and 1.0 produced tooth fractures while a backup ratio of 0.3 produced rim fractures. For a backup ratio of 0.5, the experiments produced rim fractures and the predictions produced both rim and tooth fractures, depending on the initial geometry of the crack.},

Although premature gearbox failures have plagued the wind turbine industry, and considerable research efforts continue to address this challenge, tidal turbine gearboxes are expected to experience higher mechanical failure rates given they will experience higher torque and thrust forces. In order to minimize the maintenance cost and prevent unexpected failures there exists a fundamental need for prognostic tools that can reliably estimate the current health and predict the future condition of the gearbox. This paper presents a life assessment methodology for tidal turbine gearboxes which was developed with synthetic data generated using a blade element momentum theory (BEMT) model.

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the condition monitoring of a rotating machine which is subject to load and speed fluctuations and where it is assumed that no shaft angular position measurements (tachometer, encoder, etc) are available. It is firstly proposed that a neural network may be used to remove the regular (possibly non-linear) components from the vibration signal so as to obtain a residual signal. The envelope of the residual signal is then computed by means of the Hilbert transform. The obtained transform is referred to as a discrepancy transform, since the discrepancy signal indicates the presence of fault induced signal distortions (discrepancies) which are not present in the baseline (healthy) signal. The discrepancy signal tends to be significantly simpler (smoother) than the original vibration waveform and thus tends to be more robust to slight inaccuracies during a resampling stage. The instantaneous shaft angular speed is subsequently estimated from the original vibration signal and used to approximately resample the discrepancy signal to account for frequency modulation. This paper uses a numerical model to briefly investigate how the combination of discrepancy analysis along with approximate signal resampling may be used to monitor the condition of a rotating machine which is subject to fluctuating operations when no accurate shaft angular position measurement is available.},

Prognostics, as one of the key enablers of CBM, involves the core task of estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of the system. Neural networks-based approaches have produced promising results on RUL estimation, although their performances are influenced by handcrafted features and manually specified parameters. In this paper, we propose a multiobjective deep belief networks ensemble (MODBNE) method. MODBNE employs a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm integrated with the traditional DBN training technique to evolve multiple DBNs simultaneously subject to accuracy and diversity as two conflicting objectives. The eventually evolved DBNs are combined to establish an ensemble model used for RUL estimation, where combination weights are optimized via a single-objective differential evolution algorithm using a task-oriented objective function. We evaluate the proposed method on several prognostic benchmarking data sets and also compare it with some existing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.},

The resultant predicted life not only depends on the life equation used but on the Weibull slope assumed, the least variation occurring with the Zaretsky equation. The load-life exponent p of 10/3 used in the ANSI/ABMA/ISO standards is inconsis- tent with the majority roller bearings designed and used today},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s) The paper is presenting a methodology for developing model-based method of gear fault diagnostics. First the simulation model of the helical gearbox is discussed allowing analysis of the phenomena taking place during teeth mating in the presence of manufacturing and assembly errors. It includes observation of influence of errors on the generated signals. The model was initially used to analyze the teeth contact in the presence of pitch errors and later to verify the sensitiveness of proposed diagnostic methods and their availability to detect the fatigue damages of teeth. The common feature of discussed approach is the direct use of time signal processing algorithms, and in contrary to the methods based on spectral analysis it allows precise localization of gear defects like pitting and tooth fracture associating them to the particular pinion or gear teeth. Their advantage is the simplicity and speed of action that is of great significance for the implementation in the autonomous transmission diagnostic systems and diagnostic systems working online. Presented methods of signal processing were first tested on a simulation model of the gear assembly and later verified during the experiments on a back-to-back test stand.},

abstract = {here is a constant need for the reduction of operational and maintenance costs of wind energy conversion systems (WECS). The most efficient way of reducing these costs would be to continuously monitor the condition of these systems. This allows for early detection of the degeneration of the generator health, facilitating a proactive response, minimizing downtime, and maximizing productivity. Wind generators are also inaccessible since they are situated on extremely high towers, which are normally 20 m or greater in height. There are also plans to increase the number of offshore sites increasing the need for a remote means of WECS monitoring that eliminates some of the difficulties faced due to accessibility problems. Therefore and due to the importance of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis in WECS (blades, drive trains, and generators); and keeping in mind the need for future research, this paper is intended as a tutorial overview based on a review of the state of the art, describing different type of faults, their generated signatures, and their diagnostic schemes.},

abstract = {Several of the common order tracking methods for solving noise and vibration problems of rotating machinery are reviewed. These methods include the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and resampling based order tracking algorithms. The time variant discrete Fourier transform (TVDFT) is developed as a new and alternative order tracking method. This method contains many advantages which the current order tracking methods do not possess. The TVDFT has the advantage of being very computationally efficient as well as the ability to minimise leakage errors. The basic TVDFT method may also be extended to a more complex method through the use of an orthogonality compensation matrix which can separate closely spaced orders as well as separate the contributions of crossing orders. The basic TVDFT is a combination of the FFT and the resampling based methods, a special case of the chirp-z transform. This method can be formulated in several different manners, one of which will give results matching the resampling based methods very closely. Both analytical and experimental data are used to establish the behavioural characteristics of this new method. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents a comparative study between accelerometer and laser vibrometer measurements aimed at on-line quality control carried out on the universal motors used in washing machines, which exhibit defects localised mainly in the bearings, including faults in the cage, in the rolling element and in the outer and inner ring. A set of no defective and defective motors were analysed by means of the acceleration signal provided by the accelerometer, and the displacement and velocity signals given by a single-point laser vibrometer. Advantages and disadvantages of both absolute and relative sensors and of contact and non-contact instrumentation are discussed taking into account the applicability to real on-line quality control measurements and bringing to light the related measurement problems due to the specific environmental conditions of assembly lines and sensor installation constraints. The performance of different signal-processing algorithms is discussed: RMS computation at steady-state proves effective for pass or fail diagnosis, while the amplitude of selected frequencies in the averaged spectra allows also for classification of a variety of special faults in bearings. Joint time-frequency analysis output data can be successfully used for pass or fail diagnosis during transients, thus achieving a remarkable reduction in testing time, which is important for on-line diagnostics. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The ability to forecast machinery failure is vital to reducing maintenance costs, operation downtime and safety hazards. Recent advances in condition monitoring technologies have given rise to a number of prognostic models that attempt to forecast machinery health based on condition data. This paper presents a novel approach for incorporating population characteristics information and suspended condition trending data of historical units into prognosis. The population characteristics information extracted from statistical failure distribution enables longer-range prognosis. The accurate modelling of suspended data is also found to be of great importance, since in practice machines are rarely allowed to run to failure and hence data are commonly suspended. The proposed model consists of a feed-forward neural network whose training targets are asset survival probabilities estimated using a variation of the Kaplan-Meier estimator and a degradation-based failure probability density function (PDF) estimator. The trained network is capable of estimating the future survival probabilities of an operating asset when a series of condition indices are inputted. The output survival probabilities collectively form an estimated survival curve. Pump vibration data were used for model validation. The proposed model was compared with two similar models that neglect suspended data, as well as with a conventional time series prediction model. The results support our hypothesis that the proposed model can predict more accurately and further ahead than similar methods that do not include population characteristics and/or suspended data in prognosis. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Machinery prognostics is one of the major tasks in condition based maintenance (CBM), which aims to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of machinery based on condition information. A machinery prognostic program generally consists of four technical processes, i.e., data acquisition, health indicator (HI) construction, health stage (HS) division, and RUL prediction. Over recent years, a significant amount of research work has been undertaken in each of the four processes. And much literature has made an excellent overview on the last process, i.e., RUL prediction. However, there has not been a systematic review that covers the four technical processes comprehensively. To fill this gap, this paper provides a review on machinery prognostics following its whole program, i.e., from data acquisition to RUL prediction. First, in data acquisition, several prognostic datasets widely used in academic literature are introduced systematically. Then, commonly used HI construction approaches and metrics are discussed. After that, the HS division process is summarized by introducing its major tasks and existing approaches. Afterwards, the advancements of RUL prediction are reviewed including the popular approaches and metrics. Finally, the paper provides discussions on current situation, upcoming challenges as well as possible future trends for researchers in this field.},

In this paper, modelling and vibration signature analysis of rotor with rotor-stator rub, transverse fatigue crack and unbalance is attempted. The rotor-stator interaction effects on the response of a rotor are investigated in the presence/absence of a transverse crack. The torsional vibrations are investigated for their sensitivity to rubbing using finite element model that also accounts for cross coupling of stiffness introduced due to crack. Due to the presence of both rotor-stator rub and transverse crack in a horizontal rotor, the system becomes highly nonlinear. The time localised rub excitations and nonlinear stiffness variation due to breathing of the crack influence the rotor response in both lateral and torsional modes and are explored extensively using Hilbert-Huang transform with the objective of unravelling some unique features of these faults that may be useful for fault identification. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The preparation of data sets for final classification and decision making is usually a multi-stage process. We consider data from two gearboxes, one in a healthy and the other in a faulty state. First, the gathered raw vibration data in time domain have been segmented and transformed to frequency domain using power spectral density. Next, 15 variables denoting amplitudes of calculated power spectra were extracted; these variables were further examined with respect to their diagnostic ability. We have applied here a novel hybrid approach: all subset search by using multivariate linear regression (MLR) and variables shrinkage by the least absolute selection and shrinkage operator (Lasso) performing a non-linear approach. Both methods gave consistent results and yielded subsets with healthy or faulty diagnostic properties. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Feature extraction is an important step in conventional vibration-based fault diagnosis methods. However, the features are usually empirically extracted, leading to inconsistent performance. This paper presents a new automatic and intelligent fault diagnosis method based on convolution neural network. Firstly, the vibration signal is processed by wavelet transform into a multi-scale spectrogram image to manifest the fault characteristics. Next, the spectrogram image is directly fed into convolution neural network to learn the invariant representation for vibration signal and recognize the fault status for fault diagnosis. During model construction, rectifier neural activation function and dropout layer are incorporated into convolution neural network to improve the computational efficiency and model generalization. Training data is input into traditional convolutional neural network, ReLU network, Dropout network and enhanced convolutional neural network. The classification results are reached by inputting training data and test data. Then, comparison is made on the analytical results of the four networks to conclude that the preciseness of the classification result of the enhanced convolutional neural network achieves as high as 96{\%}, 8{\%} higher than traditional convolutional neural network. Through adjusting p, the holding probability of Dropout, 3 kinds of sparse neural networks are trained and the classification results are compared. It finds, when p=0.4, the enhanced convolutional neural network achieves the best classification performance, 5{\%} and 4{\%} higher than ReLU network and Dropout network respectively. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {The first part of this series of papers addressed the theory, numerical implementation and parameter investigations of two further explored Vold-Kalman-filtering order-tracking techniques. A proposed tunable weighting factor for effectively distinguishing and separating both close and crossing order components of signals measured from rotary machines was implemented and examined. Additionally, parameters influencing waveform-tracking performance were investigated. Here, in the second paper of the series, geometric analysis to interpret dynamic signatures using order-tracking schemes is first summarised. To justify the effectiveness of applying developed techniques in practical works, three experimental tasks are accomplished. One is the separation of two close orders arising from flexible coupler imbalancing and gear meshing of a transmission-element test bench. The second task is the investigation of the dynamic characteristics of an electric scooter with a planetary gear set and four stages of speed-reduction gears using the implemented order-tracking techniques. The interactions between order components and structure resonances can be decoupled and distinguished precisely. The third task shows the successful ranking for different signature components of passby noise generated from an electric scooter with CVT transmission. This demonstrates the superiority of the angular-displacement Vold-Kalman-filtering order-tracking technique for analysing and interpreting dynamic signals arising from the operation of rotary machines. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Rotor blade condition monitoring is considered an important aspect of turbomachine management, especially with the current trend of systems operating at higher speeds, loads and temperatures. Blade Tip Timing is a non-intrusive method of performing rotor blade condition monitoring during turbomachine operation. The technique uses sensors embedded into the turbomachine casing in conjunction with a shaft encoder. A BTT system calculates the difference between the true and expected Angle of Arrival (AoA) of each blade at each sensor. This difference can be used in many ways to perform diagnostics. When calculating the AoA, the shaft speed within each revolution is often assumed as constant. This assumption is incorrect for transient conditions such as a run-up. The incorrect assumption leads to errors in the calculated AoAs. This article proposes a more accurate method for calculating the AoA. A state space equation for the shaft Instantaneous Angular Speed and Instantaneous Angular Position is derived and solved using a Kalman filter. The proposed method is validated using laboratory and field tests.},

The extracted features from original and preprocessed signals are used as inputs to the classifiers for two-class (normal or fault) recognition. The classifier parameters, e.g., the number of nodes in the hidden layer in case of ANNs and the radial basis function kernel parameter (width) in case of SVMs along with the selection of input features are optimized using genetic algorithms. The classifiers are trained with a subset of the experimental data for known machine conditions and are tested using the remaining set of data. The procedure is illustrated using the experimental vibration data of a rotating machine. The roles of different vibration signals and signal preprocessing techniques are investigated.

abstract = {Novelty detection scheme in bearing vibration signals of rotating system is investigated in this article. One class support vector machine (OC-SVM) is used for novelty detection. It focuses on the required preprocessing steps including denoising, feature extraction, vectorization, normalization and dimensionality reduction, and a systematic method is proposed for each of them. A new scheme is used for denoising which presents the best combination of mother wavelet and thresholding rule for each signal. The required features are extracted from time and time-frequency domains, and the best mother wavelet for extracting features from each signal, is presented by means of energy-to-Shannon entropy ratio criterion. It is shown that the load factor is the most important factor to impose nonlinearity in vibration signals of bearings compared to fault type and fault intensity factors. Besides, for the first time, this paper demonstrates that by increasing the nonlinearity in the signals, the statistical traditional or combinations of statistical traditional and nonlinear features fail to classify data completely and only the nonlinear features have this capability. The proposed systematic preprocessing improves the efficiency of OC-SVM novelty detection upto 100{\%} in some cases, when applied to three different data sets. Also, it yields a satisfying result compared to other similar works, in the field of classification.},

abstract = {This paper suggests an automated approach for fault detection and classification in roller bearings, which is based on pattern recognition and principal components analysis of the measured vibration signals. The signals recorded are pre-processed applying a wavelet transform in order to extract the appropriate high frequency (detailed) area needed for ball bearing fault detection. This is followed by a pattern recognition (PR) procedure used to recognise between signals coming from healthy bearings and those generated from different bearing faults. Four categories of signals are considered, namely no fault signals (from a healthy bearing), inner race fault, outer race fault and rolling element fault signals. The PR procedure uses the first six principal components extracted from the signals after a proper principal component analysis (PCA). In this work a modified PCA is suggested, which is much more appropriate for categorical data. The combination of the modified PCA and the PR method ensures that the fault is automatically detected and classified to one of the considered fault categories. The method suggested does not require the knowledge/determination of the specific fault frequencies and/or any expert analysis: once the signal filtering is done and the PC's are found the PR method automatically gives the answer if there is a fault present and its type. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Increasing the accuracy of mechanical fault detection has the potential to improve system safety and economic performance by minimizing scheduled maintenance and the probability of unexpected system failure. Advances in computational performance have enabled the application of machine learning algorithms across numerous applications including condition monitoring and failure detection. Past applications of machine learning to physical failure have relied explicitly on historical data, which limits the feasibility of this approach to in-service components with extended service histories. Furthermore, recorded failure data is often only valid for the specific circumstances and components for which it was collected. This work directly addresses these challenges for roller bearings with race faults by generating training data using information gained from high resolution simulations of roller bearing dynamics, which is used to train machine learning algorithms that are then validated against four experimental datasets. Several different machine learning methodologies are compared starting from well-established statistical feature-based methods to convolutional neural networks, and a novel application of dynamic time warping (DTW) to bearing fault classification is proposed as a robust, parameter free method for race fault detection.},

abstract = {A number of techniques for detection of faults in rolling element bearing using frequency domain approach exist today. For analysing non-stationary signals arising out of defective rolling element bearings, use of conventional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) has been known to be less efficient. One of the most suited time-frequency approach, wavelet transform (WT) has inherent problems of large computational time and fixed-scale frequency resolution. In view of such constraints, the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) technique provides multi-resolution in various frequency scales and takes the signal's frequency content and their variation into consideration. HHT analyses the vibration signal using intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), which are extracted using the process of empirical mode decomposition (EMD). However, use of Hilbert transform (HT)-based time domain approach in HHT for analysis of bearing vibration signature leads to scope for subjective error in calculation of characteristic defect frequencies (CDF) of the rolling element bearings. The time resolution significantly affects the calculation of corresponding frequency content of the signal. In the present work, FFT of IMFs from HHT process has been incorporated to utilise efficiency of HT in frequency domain. The comparative analysis presented in this paper indicates the effectiveness of using frequency domain approach in HHT and its efficiency as one of the best-suited techniques for bearing fault diagnosis (BFD). ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper presents a similarity-based approach for estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in prognostics. The approach is especially suitable for situations in which abundant run-to-failure data for an engineered system are available. Data from multiple units of the same system are used to create a library of degradation patterns. When estimating the RUL of a test unit, the data from it will be matched to those patterns in the library and the actual life of those matched units will be used as the basis of estimation. This approach is used to tackle the data challenge problem defined by the 2008 PHM Data Challenge Competition, in which, run-to-failure data of an unspecified engineered system are provided and the RUL of a set of test units will be estimated. Results show that the similarity-based approach is very effective in performing RUL estimation.},

Robust Predictive Health Monitoring tools are needed to guarantee the healthy state of rolling element bearing s during the operation. A Predictive Health Monitoring tool indicates the upcoming failures which provide sufficient lead time for maintenance planning. The Predictive Health Monitoring tool aims to monitor the deterioration i.e. wear evolution rather than just detecting the defects. The Predictive Health Monitoring procedures contain detection, diagnosis and prognosis analysis, which are required to extract the features related to the faulty rolling element bearing and estimate the remaining useful lifetime. The purpose of this study is to review the Predictive Health Monitoring methods and explore their capabilities, advantages and disadvantage in monitoring rolling element bearings. Therefore, the study provides a critical review of the Predictive Health Monitoring methods of the entire defect evolution process i.e. over the whole lifetime and suggests enhancements for rolling element bearing monitoring.},

abstract = {Condition-based maintenance is concerned with the collection and interpretation of data to support maintenance decisions. The non-intrusive nature of vibration data enables the monitoring of enclosed systems such as gearboxes. It remains a significant challenge to analyze vibration data that are generated under fluctuating operating conditions. This is especially true for situations where relatively little prior knowledge regarding the specific gearbox is available. It is therefore investigated how an adaptive time series model, which is based on Bayesian model selection, may be used to remove the non-fault related components in the structural response of a gear assembly to obtain a residual signal which is robust to fluctuating operating conditions. A statistical framework is subsequently proposed which may be used to interpret the structure of the residual signal in order to facilitate an intuitive understanding of the condition of the gear system. The proposed methodology is investigated on both simulated and experimental data from a single stage gearbox. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Park2008,
abstract = {In this dissertation, we investigate the theory and application of higher-order spectral analysis techniques to condition monitoring in shipboard electrical power systems. Monitoring and early detection of faults in rotating machines, such as induction motors, are essential for both preventive maintenance and to avoid potentially severe damage. As machines degrade, they often tend to become more nonlinear. This increased nonlinearity results in the introduction of new frequencies which satisfy particular frequency selection rules; the exact selection rule depends on the order of the nonlinearity. In addition, the phases of the newly generated frequencies satisfy a similar phase selection rule. This results in a phase coherence, or phase coupling, between the “original” interacting frequencies and the “new” frequencies. This phase coupling is a true signature of nonlinearity. Since the classical auto-power spectrum contains no phase information, the phase coupling signature associated with nonlinear interactions is not available. However, various higher-order spectra (HOS) are capable of detecting such nonlinear-induced phase coupling. The efficacy of the various proposed HOS-based methodologies is investigated using real-world vibration time-series data from a faulted induction motor driving a dc generator. The fault is controlled by varying a resistor placed in one phase of the three-phase line to the induction motor. First, we propose a novel method using a bispectral change detection (BCD) for condition monitoring. Even though the bicoherence is dominant and powerful in the detection of phase coupling of nonlinearly interacting frequencies, it has some difficulties in its application to machine condition monitoring. Basically, the bicoherence may not be able to distinguish between intrinsic nonlinearities associated with healthy machines and fault-induced nonlinearities. Therefore, the ability to discriminate the fault-only nonlinearities from the intrinsic nonlinearities is very important. The proposed BCD method can suppress the intrinsic nonlinearities of a healthy machine by nulling them out and thereby identify the fault-only nonlinearities. In addition, most machines contain rotating components, and the vibration fields they generate are periodic. These periodic impulse train signals may produce artificially high bicoherence values and can lead to ambiguous indications of faults in machine condition monitoring. The proposed BCD method can remove the artificially high bicoherence values caused by periodic impulse-train signals. With these advantages, the proposed BCD method is a new and sensitive indicator for condition monitoring. Second, we propose a novel method to estimate, from a measured single time-series data record, complex coupling coefficients in order to quantify the “strength” of nonlinear frequency interactions associated with rotating machine degradation. The estimation of the coupling coefficients is based on key concepts from higher-order spectral analysis and least mean-square-error{\ldots}},

abstract = {In the context of maintenance activities maintainers rely on machine information, their past breakdowns, adequate repair methods and guidelines as well as new research results in the area. They usually get access to information and knowledge by using information systems (nondestructive testing (NDT) or condition monitoring.), local databases, e-resources or traditional print media. Basically it can be assumed that, the amount of available information affects the quality of maintenance decision making and acting positively. Machine health information retrieval is the application of information retrieval concepts and techniques to the operation and maintenance domain. Retrieving Contextual information, describing the operational conditions for the machine, is a subarea of information retrieval that incorporates context features in the search process towards its improvement.. Both areas have been gaining interest from the research community in order to perform more accurate prognostics according to specific scenarios and happening circumstances. Context is a broad term and in this paper the operational conditions and the way the machine has been used is seen as the context and is represented by operational data collected over time. This paper intends to investigate the effects of the interaction of context features on machine tools health information. This interaction between context and health assessment is bidirectional in the sense that health information seeking behavior can also be used to predict context features that can be used, without disturbing the operational environment and creating production disruptions. The extraction of multiple features from multiple sensors, already deployed in this type of machinery, may constitute snapshots of the current health of certain machine components. The mutation status (the way they have changed) of these snapshots, hereafter called Fingerprints, has been proposed as prognostic marker in machine tools problems. Of them, in this work so far only the spindle fingerprint mutation has been validated independently as prognostic for overall survival and survival after relapse, while the prognostic value of rest of components mutation is still under validation. In this scenario, the prognostic value of spindle fingerprint mutations can be investigated in various contexts defined by stratifications of the machine population.},

abstract = {A computational model for determination of static capacity and fatigue lifetime of large slewing bearings is presented. In the proposed model, contact load distribution along the bearing raceways is calculated on the basis of the static equilibrium between contact loads acting on the raceways, and external loads acting on the bearing. On the basis of the maximum contact force and some typical and experimentally determined material parameters, the static capacity of a bearing is calculated and a comparison of different approaches for a calculation of the fatigue lifetime of a bearing is presented. The following calculation methods are compared: ISO standardised calculation approach, a stress-life approach and a strain-life approach. The presented vector based calculation approach for a calculation of the contact load distribution seems to be an appropriate approach for a fast evaluation of the influence of the bearing clearance and the deformation of bearing rings on the contact load distribution. The comparison of fatigue lifetimes calculated with different calculation methods shows that the choice of method for the calculation of an equivalent mean stress significantly effects the calculated lifetimes. Furthermore, the comparison of lifetimes also shows that, by assuming that ISO standardised calculation approach gives relevant results and provided that material parameters are properly defined, the stress-life approach is, to some degree, a proper method for calculation of the rolling bearing fatigue lifetime. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The design results illustrate that the strategy used in this paper is sufficient and multi-point design requirements of the passenger aircraft are reached. The visualization level of non-dominant Pareto set is improved by effectively reducing the dimension without losing the primary feature of the problem.},

abstract = {With the privatization and intense competition that characterize the volatile energy sector, the gas turbine industry currently faces new challenges of increasing operational flexibility, reducing operating costs, improving reliability and availability while mitigating the environmental impact. In this complex, changing sector, the gas turbine community could address a set of these challenges by further development of high fidelity, more accurate and computationally efficient engine health assessment, diagnostic and prognostic systems. Recent studies have shown that engine gas-path performance monitoring still remains the cornerstone for making informed decisions in operation and maintenance of gas turbines. This paper offers a systematic review of recently developed engine performance monitoring, diagnostic and prognostic techniques. The inception of performance monitoring and its evolution over time, techniques used to establish a high-quality dataset using engine model performance adaptation, and effects of computationally intelligent techniques on promoting the implementation of engine fault diagnosis are reviewed. Moreover, recent developments in prognostics techniques designed to enhance the maintenance decision-making scheme and main causes of gas turbine performance deterioration are discussed to facilitate the fault identification module. The article aims to organize, evaluate and identify patterns and trends in the literature as well as recognize research gaps and recommend new research areas in the field of gas turbine performance-based monitoring. The presented insightful concepts provide experts, students or novice researchers and decision-makers working in the area of gas turbine engines with the state of the art for performance-based condition monitoring.},

The putative nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared with those of GPx7 from other metazoans and phylogenetic analysis suggests the presence of a high evolutionary pressure in the contest of neutral evolution. The mRNA of CrGPx7 is located in hemocytes and ovarian follicular cells, as revealed by in situ hybridization. The time course of CrGPx7 mRNA levels in the presence of Cd, Cu and Zn, showed upregulation in the final stages of the experiments, suggesting a role of GPx7 in late protection from oxidative stress. Our in silico analyses of the crgpx7 promoter region revealed putative consensus sequences similar to mammalian metal-responsive elements (MRE) and xenobiotic-responsive elements (XRE), suggesting that the transcription of these genes directly depends on metals. Cell-free extract from C. robusta tissues show the presence of selenium-independent GPx activity that is inhibited by the presence of metals.},

abstract = {An important step in model-based fault detection is residual evaluation, where residuals are evaluated with the aim to detect changes in their behavior caused by faults. To handle residuals subject to time-varying uncertainties and disturbances, which indeed are present in practice, a novel statistical residual evaluation approach is presented. The main contribution is to base the residual evaluation on an explicit comparison of the probability distribution of the residual, estimated online using current data, with a no-fault residual distribution. The no-fault distribution is based on a set of a priori known no-fault residual distributions, and is continuously adapted to the current situation. As a second contribution, a method is proposed for estimating the required set of no-fault residual distributions off-line from no-fault training data. The proposed residual evaluation approach is evaluated with measurement data on a residual for fault detection in the gas-flow system of a Scania truck diesel engine. Results show that small faults can be reliably detected with the proposed approach in cases where regular methods fail. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Currently, vibration-based damage detection is an area of significant research activity. This paper attempts to extend the research in this field through the application of statistical analysis procedures to the vibration-based damage detection problem. The damage detection process is cast in the context of a statistical pattern recognition paradigm. In particular, this paper focuses on applying statistical process control methods referred to as 'control charts' to vibration-based damage detection. First, an autoregressive (AR) model is fit to the measured acceleration-time histories from an undamaged structure. Residual errors, which quantify the difference between the prediction from the AR model and the actual measured time history at each time interval, are used as the damage-sensitive features. Next, the X-bar and S control charts are employed to monitor the mean and variance of the selected features. Control limits for the control charts are constructed based on the features obtained from the initial intact structure. The residual errors computed from the previous AR model and subsequent new data are then monitored relative to the control limits. A statistically significant number of error terms outside the control limits indicate a system transit from a healthy state to a damage state. For demonstration, this statistical process control is applied to vibration test data acquired from a concrete bridge column as the column is progressively damaged.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} IMechE 2015.This paper investigates the possibility of using a coarse finite element model with bulk material properties, to model the vertical force-displacement characteristics of a tyre, for the purpose of tyre model parameterization. The paper proves the approach on an off-road tyre of a light truck. The practical application is intended, however, for very large tyres where physical testing is not feasible. The paper indicates that it is feasible to obtain bulk material properties from tensile tests on specimens cut from different positions on a tyre and to use these test results to parameterize suitable non-linear anisotropic material models. The non-linear elements defined in the neo-Hookean model and the Ogden model, as well as the elements with different linear orthogonal stiffnesses, are combined with each other to simulate the global material properties of the tread and the sidewall of the tyre. The global behaviour of the finite element model is analysed by comparing experimental results and simulation data on a flat surface as well as various lateral and longitudinal cleats. The results confirm that the finite element model can predict with acceptable accuracy the vertical force-displacement characteristics, as well as the sidewall deformation of the tyre under static loading conditions on a flat surface and also on various different cleats, by using equivalent (global) material properties. The approach is sufficiently accurate to be used in the parameterization of various tyre models.},

The early detection of mechanical malfunction that can be provided by an effective vibration monitoring system is essential.

A model consisting of an overhung whirling rotor is utilized to match an experimental test rig. A 2X harmonic component of the system response is shown to be the primary response characteristic resulting from the introduction of a crack.

abstract = {A new method for intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery based on wavelet packet transform (WPT), empirical mode decomposition (EMD), dimensionless parameters, a distance evaluation technique and radial basis function (RBF) network is proposed in this paper. In this method, WPT and EMD are, respectively, used to preprocess vibration signals to mine fault characteristic information more accurately. Then, dimensionless parameters in time domain are extracted from each of the original vibration signals and preprocessed signals to form a combined feature set. Moreover, the distance evaluation technique is utilised to calculate evaluation factors of the combined feature set. Finally, according to the evaluation factors, the corresponding sensitive features are selected and input into the RBF network to automatically identify different machine operation conditions. An experiment of rolling element bearings is carried out to test the performance of the proposed method. The experimental result demonstrates that the method combining WPT, EMD, the distance evaluation technique and the RBF network may accurately extract fault information and select sensitive features, and therefore it may correctly diagnose the different fault categories occurring in the bearings. Furthermore, this method is applied to slight rub fault diagnosis of a heavy oil catalytic cracking unit, the actual result shows the method may be applied to fault diagnosis of rotating machinery effectively. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {LPS is one of the pathogen associated molecular patterns that activates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway eliciting antiviral host responses in mammals although information on such responses in avian species is scarce. Our objectives were to characterize the LPS induced innate responses particularly the expression of LPS receptors (TLR4, CD14) in avian macrophages and observe whether TLR4 mediated induction of NO can elicit antiviral response against infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) replication. We found that LPS was capable of inducing the expression of TLR4, CD14 and NO production but not the type 1 interferons in an avian macrophage cell line, MQ-NCSU. We also showed that TLR4 mediated NO production can lead to antiviral response against ILTV replication when MQ-NCSU cells were treated with LPS and the resultant supernatant was then transferred to ILTV replicating cells to assess antiviral activity. Antiviral activity of NO was blocked by a selective inhibitor, S-methylisothiourea sulfhate that inhibits inducible NO synthase. This observation confirms that the antiviral activity is positively correlated with NO production. The data show that LPS can be a potential innate immune stimulant that can be used against ILTV infection in chickens that require further evaluation in vivo. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

Some of the developed diagnostic techniques rely on the availability of historical fault data, which is impractical or even impossible to obtain in many circumstances and therefore novelty detection techniques such as discrepancy analysis are used. However, discrepancy analysis assumes that the condition of the machine is the same throughout the signal in the model optimisation process i.e. no localised damage is present, which can pose problems if the training data unwittingly contain a component with localised damage. In this paper, an automatic procedure is proposed for diagnosing localised gear damage in the presence of fluctuating operating conditions, with no historical data being required to model the data used in the condition inference process. The continuous wavelet transform, principal component analysis and information theory are used to obtain divergence data of the gear under consideration. The divergence data are used with Bayesian data analysis techniques to automatically infer the presence of localised anomalies due to localised gear damage. The proposed technique is validated in two experimental investigations, with promising results being obtained.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},

Aiming to present the spectral structures of vibration signals of epicyclic gearboxes, phenomenological models of vibration signals of epicyclic gearboxes are developed by algebraic equations and spectral structures of these models are deduced using Fourier series analysis. In the phenomenological models, all the possible vibration transfer paths from gear meshing points to a fixed transducer and the effects of angular shifts of planet gears on the spectral structures are considered. Accordingly, time-varying vibration transfer paths from sun-planet/ring-planet gear meshing points to the fixed transducer due to carrier rotation are given by window functions with different amplitudes. And an angular shift in one planet gear position is introduced in the process of modeling. After the theoretical derivations, three experiments are conducted on an epicyclic gearbox test rig and the spectral structures of collected vibration signals are analyzed. As a result, the effects of angular shifts of planet gears are verified, and the phenomenological models of vibration signals when a local fault occurs on the sun gear and the planet gear are validated, respectively. The experiment results demonstrate that the established phenomenological models in this paper are helpful to the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of epicyclic gearboxes.},

abstract = {In order to discriminate small changes for early fault diagnosis of rotating machines, condition monitoring demands that the measurement of instantaneous angular speed (IAS) of the machines be as accurate as possible. This paper develops the theoretical basis and practical implementation of IAS data acquisition and IAS estimation when noise influence is included. IAS data is modelled as a frequency modulated signal of which the signal-to-noise ratio can be improved by using a high-resolution encoder. From this signal model and analysis, optimal configurations for IAS data collection are addressed for high accuracy IAS measurement. Simultaneously, a method based on analytic signal concept and fast Fourier transform is also developed for efficient and accurate estimation of IAS. Finally, a fault diagnosis is carried out on an electric induction motor driving system using IAS measurement. The diagnosis results show that using a high-resolution encoder and a long data stream can achieve noise reduction by more than 10 dB in the frequency range of interest, validating the model and algorithm developed. Moreover, the results demonstrate that IAS measurement outperforms conventional vibration in diagnosis of incipient faults of motor rotor bar defects and shaft misalignment. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Against the backdrop of growing wind turbine capacity, the failure of wind turbines is becoming increasingly serious. Based on the three primary configurations and failure statistics analysis of wind turbines in China, this paper summarizes the failures of wind turbine components, such as frequency converters, generators, gearboxes, pitch systems, yaw systems, blades, braking systems and sub-synchronous machines. Although there are many failure types and various causes, we can deduce four primary reasons for these failures: lack of core technologies; inferior quality due to price competition; design standards and wind farm climate differences; and no mandatory quality certification and exterior factors, such as wind farm construction, power grids and maintenance. Finally, while aiming to improve the reliability, a reliability management method with regard to the design, manufacturing and maintenance of wind turbines was proposed.},

abstract = {The narrowband amplitude demodulation of a vibration signal enables the extraction of components carrying information about rotating machine faults. However, the quality of the demodulated signal depends on the frequency band selected for the demodulation. The spectral kurtosis (SK) was proved to be a very efficient method for detection of such faults, including defective rolling element bearings and gears [1]. Although there are conditions, under which SK yields valid results, there are also cases, when it fails, e.g. in the presence of a relatively strong, non-Gaussian noise containing high peaks or for a relatively high repetition rate of fault impulses. In this paper, a novel method for selection of the optimal frequency band, which attempts to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks, is presented. Subsequently, a new tool for presentation of results of the method, called the Protrugram, is proposed. The method is based on the kurtosis of the envelope spectrum amplitudes of the demodulated signal, rather than on the kurtosis of the filtered time signal. The advantage of the method is the ability to detect transients with smaller signal-to-noise ratio comparing to the SK-based Fast Kurtogram. The application of the proposed method is validated on simulated and real data, including a test rig, a simulated signal, and a jet engine vibration signal. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {An effective wear-monitoring system for machine tool inserts could yield significant cost savings for manufacturers. Over the years, various methods have been proposed to achieve tool condition monitoring (TCM), and recently sensor-based approaches for indirectly estimating tool wear have become highly popular. One difficulty with collecting sensory information from machine tools is that the signal-to-noise ratio of useful information about the tool wear is extremely poor. This problem can be overcome by using advanced signal-processing methods and also by fusing the information obtained from numerous sensors into a single modelling or decision-making scheme such as neural networks (NNs). Neural networks are known for their capacity to solve problems effectively in cases where theoretical/analytical models cannot be established. Furthermore, NNs can handle noisy and incomplete data such as that typically obtained from machining operations. Although numerous authors have proposed the NN approach for TCM, various problems still hamper a practical method of applying the technique for industrial use. This paper proposes a technique which should overcome these difficulties. A cost-effective and reliable tool condition monitoring system (TCMS) was developed, utilising the advantages of NNs for a typical industrial machining operation. The operation considered is interrupted turning (facing and boring) of Aluminium alloy components for the automotive industry. The development and implementation of various hardware and software components for the proposed technique are described in this paper. The main advantages of the technique are its accuracy, reliability and cost-effectiveness. {\textcopyright} 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = { To truly optimize the deployment of DoD assets, there exists a fundamental need for predictive tools that can reliably estimate the current and reasonably predict the future capacity of complex systems. Prognosis, as in all true predictions, has inherent uncertainty, which has been treated through probabilistic modeling approaches. The novelty in the current prognostic tool development is that predictions are made through the fusion of stochastic physics-of-failure models, relevant system or component level health monitoring data and various inspection results. Regardless of the fidelity of a prognostic model or the quantity and quality of the seeded fault or run-to-failure data, these models should be adaptable based on system health features such as vibration, temperature, and oil analysis. The inherent uncertainties and variability in material capacity and localized environmental conditions, as well as the realization that complex physics-of-failure understanding will always possess some uncertainty, all contribute to the stochastic nature of prognostic modeling. However, accuracy can be improved by creating a prognostic architecture instilled with the ability to account for unexpected damage events, fuse with diagnostic results, and statistically calibrate predictions based on inspection information and real-time system level features. In this paper, the aforementioned process is discussed and implemented first on controlled failures of single spur gear teeth and then on a helical gear contained within a drivetrain system. The stochastic, physics-of-failure models developed are validated with transitional run-to-failure data developed at Penn State ARL. Future work involves applying the advanced prognostics process to helicopter gearboxes.},

Among those datasets are five C-MAPSS datasets that have been extremely popular due to their unique characteris-tics making them suitable for prognostics. The C-MAPSS datasets pose several challenges that have been tackled by different methods in the PHM literature. In particular, man-agement of high variability due to sensor noise, effects of operating conditions, and presence of multiple simultaneous fault modes are some factors that have great impact on the generalization capabilities of prognostics algorithms. More than 70 publications have used the C-MAPSS datasets for de-veloping data-driven prognostic algorithms. The C-MAPSS datasets are also shown to be well-suited for development of new machine learning and pattern recognition tools for sev-eral key preprocessing steps such as feature extraction and selection, failure mode assessment, operating conditions as-sessment, health status estimation, uncertainty management, and prognostics performance evaluation.

As a data-driven method, PSW describes the dynamical behavior of the bearing being tested on a fast-time scale, whereas the Paris crack growth model, as a physics-based model, characterizes the bearing's defect propagation on a slow-time scale. Theoretically, PSW constructs a tracking metric by evaluating the phase space trajectory warping of the bearing vibration data, and establishes a correlation between measurement on a fast-time scale and defect growth variables on a slow-time scale. Furthermore, PSW is enhanced by a multi-dimensional auto-regression (AR) model for improved accuracy in defect tracking. Also, the Paris crack growth model is modified by a time-piecewise algorithm for real-time RUL prediction. Case studies performed on two run-to-failure experiments indicate that the developed technique is effective in tracking the evolution of bearing defects and accurately predict the bearing RUL, thus contributing to the literature of bearing prognosis.},

The paper concludes with significant considerations for future research. Each of the techniques was found to have unique concepts/principles, procedures, and challenges for real industrial practise. It can be concluded that the application of the CBM technique is more realistic, and thus more worthwhile to apply, than the TBM one.

abstract = {Blade Tip Timing (BTT) has been in existence for many decades as an attractive vibration based condition monitoring technique for turbomachine blades. The technique is non-intrusive and online monitoring is possible. For these reasons, BTT may be regarded as a feasible technique to track the condition of turbomachine blades, thus preventing unexpected and catastrophic failures. The processing of BTT data to find the associated vibration characteristics is however non-trivial. In addition, these vibration characteristics are difficult to validate, therefore resulting in great uncertainty of the reliability of BTT techniques. This article therefore proposes a hybrid approach comprising a stochastic Finite Element Model (FEM) based modal analysis and Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR) based BTT technique. The use of this stochastic hybrid approach is demonstrated for the identification and classification of turbomachine blade damage. For the purposes of this demonstration, discrete damage is incrementally introduced to a simplified test blade of an experimental rotor setup. The damage identification and classification processes are further used to determine whether a damage threshold has been reached, therefore providing sufficient evidence to schedule a turbomachine outage. It is shown that the proposed stochastic hybrid approach may offer many short- and long-term benefits for practical implementation.},

Our experiments with artiicial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with RTRL, BPTT, Recurrent Cascade-Correlation, Elman nets, and Neural Sequence Chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artiicial long time lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

It often results in failure of gear unit operation. Fault analyses presented in this article are based on gear units with real damages or faults, produced on the basis of real operating conditions. A test plant has been used. A possible damage can be identified by monitoring vibrations. The influences of a crack in a single-stage gear unit on produced vibrations are presented. A fatigue crack in the tooth root causes significant changes in tooth stiffness, whereas, in relation to other faults, changes of other dynamic parameters are more expressed. Different methods are used to analyse signals acquired by experiments. Signal analysis has been carried out in relation to a non-stationary signal, using the family of Time Frequency Analysis tools, such as Wavelets Analyses. Typical spectrogram and scalogram patterns resulting from reactions to faults or damages indicate the presence of damages in a very reliable way. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A modal analysis method is used to evaluate the elasto-acoustic modal characteristics for the coupled system. Effect of the fluid inside the gearbox on the vibration response is discussed. The combined use of this FE/RI model enables evaluation of the acoustic response. A case study of a simplified gearbox internally excited with gear mesh stiffness fluctuation is presented.

These technologies are often layered on top of the existing infrastructure and legacy information systems. The management and utilization of the data generated from the different components of the electrical system are critical for the successful deployment and operation of this system. This paper reviews the issues and opportunities of the use of Big Data for electric utilities. Big Data provides the opportunity to better monitor, correct, and integrate smart grid technologies and renewable energy. At the same time, data management and utilization must be integrated into organizational operations if the potentials are to be realized. Electric utilities are conservative, heavily-regulated, and concerned with both system reliability and overall profitability. Thus, technological, economic, institutional, and policy constraints must all be addressed. After reviewing these issues and opportunities, we empirically analyze whether these are part of the discussions about electric utilities with federal policymakers. The results show that while conversations about electric utilities overall are plentiful, conversations about data in the context of electric utilities are relatively rare.},

The number of bearings in a machine, say a Turbo-Generator (TG) set, is likely to be very high hence increasing sensors to a large number. Therefore results in huge data sets to analyse to track any fault(s) which often depends on the experience and the engineering judgments in fault detection process. The effort of the present study is to reduce the number of sensors per bearing pedestals by enhancing the computational effort in signal processing. The concept used was fusion of the data from all sensors in the frequency domain to get a composite spectrum for a machine and then the computation of the higher order spectra (HOS) so that the vibration data is managed efficiently and able to detect fault uniquely. The results of the suggested approach are discussed here. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of critical assets is an important challenge in condition based maintenance to improve reliability and decrease machine's breakdown and maintenance's cost. Bearing is one of the most important components in industries which need to be monitored and the user should predict its RUL. The challenge of this study is to propose an original feature able to evaluate the health state of bearings and to estimate their RUL by Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) techniques. In this paper, the proposed method is based on the data-driven prognostic approach. The combination of Simplified Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory Map (SFAM) neural network and Weibull distribution (WD) is explored. WD is used just in the training phase to fit measurement and to avoid areas of fluctuation in the time domain. SFAM training process is based on fitted measurements at present and previous inspection time points as input. However, the SFAM testing process is based on real measurements at present and previous inspections. Thanks to the fuzzy learning process, SFAM has an important ability and a good performance to learn nonlinear time series. As output, seven classes are defined; healthy bearing and six states for bearing degradation. In order to find the optimal RUL prediction, a smoothing phase is proposed in this paper. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reliably predict the RUL of rolling element bearings (REBs) based on vibration signals. The proposed prediction approach can be applied to prognostic other various mechanical assets.},

abstract = {This paper deals with a new scheme for the prediction of a ball bearing's remaining useful life based on self-organizing map (SOM) and back propagation neural network methods. One of the key components needed for effective bearing life prediction is the set-up of an appropriate degradation indicator from a bearing's incipient defect stage to its final failure. This new method is different from the others that have been used in the past, in that it uses the minimum quantisation error (MQE) indicator derived from SOM, which is trained by six vibration features, including a new designed degradation index for performance degradation assessment. Then, using this indicator, back propagation neural networks focusing on the degradation periods can be trained. Thanks to weight application to failure times (WAFT) technology, a useful life prediction model for ball bearings has been developed successfully. Finally, a set of accelerated bearing run-to-failure experiments is carried out, with the experimental results showing that the new proposed methods are greatly superior to those, based on L10 bearing life prediction, currently being used. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Residual effects of geometry are usually removed by an AC coupling. This paper presents a new approach in LDV velocity data processing that allows the processing of the velocity data obtained with a Scanning LDV in the Eulerian approach on a rolling tire in order to obtain not only ODS but also static shape. This technique does not require additional sensors or systems since it is based only on signal processing.

The model includes key system parameters such as number of planets, planet position angles, and planet phasing relationships defined by the position angles and the number of teeth of the gears. The model is used to simulate a wide range of gear sets to show that they can be classified in five distinct groups based on their sideband behavior in terms of their frequencies and amplitudes. A special experimental planetary gear set-up is developed and planetary gear sets from of three of these five groups are procured. A methodology is developed to demonstrate modulation sidebands from the ring (internal) gear radial acceleration measurements. For each case, sets of ring gear acceleration measurements at various speed and torque conditions are presented to demonstrate rich sideband activity that agrees well with the model predictions. At the end, based on results of the parametric studies and experiments, general rules on modulation sidebands of planetary gear sets are proposed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The management of unpaved mine road networks - characterized by high$\backslash$naxle loadings, low traffic volumes, variable materials and construction$\backslash$nquality, and rapid rates of deterioration - is often inadequate.$\backslash$nThis situation results in either overmaintenance of the road or failure$\backslash$nto recognize significant deterioration, which both lead to the application$\backslash$nof suboptimal road maintenance strategies with the attendant increase$\backslash$nin total road-user costs. A real-time condition-triggered maintenance$\backslash$nmanagement system was identified as a solution, in which onboard$\backslash$nmonitoring of vehicle dynamic response to road condition forms the$\backslash$nbasis of road defect recognition and maintenance response. A practical$\backslash$napproach to road defect reconstruction using measured truck response$\backslash$nis presented. Initially, the application context is introduced, then$\backslash$nthe field testing program is described, in which data sets were generated$\backslash$nthat served as the basis for mathematical modeling of the truck response.$\backslash$nA modeling approach utilizing the concept of independent front suspension$\backslash$ndynamic equilibrium is described as the basis for road defect recognition.$\backslash$nOn the basis of measured suspension forces and the acceleration of$\backslash$nthe unsprung mass, the approach to tire force and road defect reconstruction$\backslash$nis presented. It is concluded that the methodology developed enables$\backslash$nreconstruction of road defect geometries with an accuracy sufficient$\backslash$nto allow specific types and dimensions of defects to be recognized$\backslash$nfor the purpose of road maintenance. By extending the methodology$\backslash$nto public unpaved roads, maintenance could be applied as and where$\backslash$nneeded with a resultant reduction in authority cost and improvement$\backslash$nin service provided for the road user.},

In normal operating conditions this kind of damage can be revealed by classical vibration analyses, such as Spectral or Envelope ones. Furthermore, this last technique - by working in time domain - makes it possible to monitor the longitudinal dimension of the defect. In this paper, the limits of the mentioned methodologies are presented by showing their application to bearings affected by different pitting failures on the outer or inner race or a rolling element and subjected to a very low radial load. Results are compared with that obtained by an advanced signal processing method based on the evaluation of the wavelet transform.

abstract = {In clustering spatial data, we are given a set of points in R n and the objective is to find the clusters (representing spatial objects) in the set of points. Finding clusters with different shapes, sizes, and densities in data with noise and potentially outliers is a challenging task. This problem is especially studied in machine learning community and has lots of applications. We present a novel clustering technique, which can solve mentioned issues considerably. In the proposed algorithm, we let the structure of the data set itself find the clusters, this is done by having points actively send and receive feedbacks to each other. The idea of the proposed method is to transform the input data set into a graph by adding edges between points that belong to the same cluster, so as connected components correspond to clusters, whereas points in different clusters are almost disconnected. At the start, our algorithm creates a preliminary graph and tries to improve it iteratively. In order to build the graph (add more edges), each point sends feedback to its neighborhood points. The neighborhoods and the feedback to be sent are determined by investigating the received feedbacks. This process continues until a stable graph is created. Henceforth, the clusters are formed by post-processing the constructed graph. Our algorithm is intuitive, easy to state and analyze, and does not need to have lots of parameter tuning. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms existing related methods in this area. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

abstract = {In this paper an indicator is used that reflects the "state" of a system as a function of the ages of the (groups of) subsystems of which it consists. The contribution of the ages of the subsystems to the state of the system is defined by their weights. The indicator can be interpreted as the virtual age of the system, and can therefore be used to define age-reduction factors of different types of repair in a virtual age or age-reduction process. The state indicator is used as the time scale in a proportional intensity model. In this way, the joint impact of different repair strategies and covariates on the system failure intensity can be evaluated. This relationship is then used to address the question of which subsystems to replace whenever a system comes in for repair and when to set the preventive inspection/repair interval, in order to minimize the expected costs per unit time until the next inspection and/or repair. A numerical and a practical example are given. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The proposed method is an extension of an existing Kalman Filter (KF) ensemble method. While the original method has shown great promise in the earlier PHM 2008 Data Challenge, the main limitation of the KF ensemble is that it is only applicable to linear models. In prognostics, degradation of mechanical systems is typically non-linear in nature, therefore limiting the applications of KF ensemble in this area. To circumvent this problem, this paper propose to approximate non-linear functions with piecewise linear functions. When estimating the RUL, the Switching Kalman Filter (SKF) is able to choose the most probable degradation mode and thus make better predictions. The implementation of the proposed SKF ensemble method is illustrated by implementing on NASA's C-MAPSS Dataset as well as the PHM 2008 Data Challenge Dataset. The results show the effectiveness of the SKF in detecting the switching point between various degradation modes as well as the improved accuracy of the SKF ensemble method compared to other available methods in literature.},

abstract = {The investigation of torsional vibration of rotating machines and rotational vibration of structural systems has been hindered by the lack of suitable transducers and torsional exciters. The advent of the laser torsional vibrometer has provided an accurate non-contact measurement technique for rotating machines. There is a requirement for further advancement in torsional excitation methods, particularly for low cost, low torque applications. In this paper, experimental results are presented which demonstrate that a commercially available a.c. servo-drive may be used as a combined drive motor and torsional exciter for small rotating test rigs. Two optimum servo-amplifier settings were identified and the maximum sinusoidal dynamic torque capacity running unloaded (below 1400 r.p.m.) was measured to be 1-10 Nm (r.m.s.), at frequencies up to at least 2 kHz. Random excitation was also possible at lower frequencies. The servo-drive will find applications in torsional vibration testing of small rotating machines and potentially for structural testing. The exciter has been characterized (i.e., the torsional stiffness and damping were measured) over the full speed range (2000 r.p.m.), so that the performance when attached to a particular test system may be predicted. Because previous researchers have demonstrated that inconsistent results may be obtained when experimentally measuring torsional damping levels, independent frequency and time domain techniques were used to determine the torsional stiffness and damping properties of the servo-drive, over a range of operating conditions of speed, load and torsional excitation level. A high degree of consistency was obtained between the results provided by using the different techniques under appropriate test conditions. The servo-drive was found to be a non-linear SDOF torsional system, with stiffness and damping levels dependent on motor speed, torsional excitation level and load inertia. {\textcopyright} 1997 Academic Press Limited.},

abstract = {Grass pollen, especially of rye-grass (Lolium perenne), represents an important cause of type I allergy. Identification of IgE-binding (allergenic) epitopes of major grass pollen allergens is essential for understanding the molecular basis of interaction between allergens and human IgE antibodies and therefore facilitates the devising of safer and more effective diagnostic and immunotherapy reagents. The aim of this study was to identify the allergenic epitopes of Lol p 5, a major allergen of rye-grass pollen, immunodissect these epitopes further so that the amino acid residues critical for antibody binding can be determined and investigate the conservation and nature of these epitopes within the context of the natural grass pollen allergens. Peptides, 12 13 amino acid residues long and overlapping each other by 4 amino acid residues, based on the entire deduced amino acid sequence of the coding region of Lol p 5, were synthesised and assayed for IgE-binding. Two strong IgE-binding epitopes (Lol p 5 (49-60) and (265-276), referred to as peptides 7 and 34, respectively) were identified. These epitopes were further resolved by truncated peptides and amino acid replacement studies and the amino acid residues critical for IgE-binding determined (Lol p 5 (49-60) residue Lys57and (265-276) residue Lys275). Sequences of these epitopes were conserved in related allergens and may form the conserved allergenic domains responsible for the cross-reactivity observed between pollen allergens of taxonomically related grasses. Furthermore, due to its strong IgE-reactivity, synthetic peptide Lol p 5 (265-276) was used to affinity- purify specific IgE antibodies which recognised proteins of other clinically important grass pollens, further indicating presence of allergenic cross- reactivity at the level of allergenic epitope. Moreover, Lol p 5 (265-276) demonstrated a strong capacity to inhibit IgE-binding to natural rye-grass pollen proteins highlighting the antibody accessibility to these sequences within the context of the natural allergens. Strong IgE-binding epitopes of Lol p 5 have been identified down to single critical amino acid residues and are shown to occur as linear or continuous domains in the natural conformation of natural Lol p 5 and other group 5 grass pollen allergens. The fact that such an allergenic synthetic epitope has the capacity to strongly inhibit IgE-binding to natural allergens highlight its potential for use as a candidate in future therapeutics to treat pollen-associated allergies.},

In order to understand the fundamental nature of planetary gearbox vibration, this paper conducts an investigation on vibration characteristics of a single-stage planetary gearbox. Assuming that the gearbox and the sensor revolve inversely at the speed of planet carrier, the problem can be transformed into two easier parts: research on fixed-shaft gearbox signal model and research on influence of sensor spinning. Based on this assumption, a vibration signal model of planetary gearbox is obtained. Experimental data are used to validate the model.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose an original method for the estimation of the instantaneous speed relative fluctuation (ISRF) in a vibration signal measured on a system submitted to relatively heavy load and speed fluctuations and without speed measurement available. Our approach is based on the estimation of an instantaneous time-scaling factor along the vibration signal, related to the instantaneous relative speed gap from time t = 0. It extends a previous work related to the estimation of the relative speed gap between two stationary signals via the Scale transform. In a non-stationary situation the method is performed between segments of the signal, which we coin the short time scale transform. In order to adjust the optimal length of the segments we propose an optimisation scheme based on the Kurtosis maximisation of the amplitude spectrum of the angular resampled signal using the estimated ISRF. Contrary to conventional methods based on the instantaneous frequency estimation of one spectral component, the proposed method for ISRF estimation does not depend on the choice of one particular component. The algorithm is relatively simple to implement and has a reasonable computation cost. However, it is not advised to use it in the case of very large speed variations such as during a speed-up. The method is then applied to the vibration measurements of two different planetary gearboxes used in the mining industry, first one with available speed measurement for validation, and second one with advanced wear of the planetary stage and without speed information. In this latter case the estimated ISRF is used in order to establish a diagnosis of the system. Crown Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008.},

It is shown that, under otherwise comparable situations, (a) different oil-steel combinations allow the operation to penetrate by different degrees into the boundary lubrication regime before scuffing occurs, (b) an increase in the sliding velocity, at constant sum velocity, decreases the scuff failure load and the critical temperature, (c) an increase in the sum velocity, at constant sliding velocity, increases the scuff failure load and the critical temperature, (d) the effect of changing the sliding velocity or sum velocity, at a constant sliding-to-sum velocity ratio, depends on the balance of the opposing effects of sliding ans sum velocities at the particualar velocity ratio of interest, and (e) the scuff failure load and the critical temperature are markedly increased when the potential failure sites on the disk surfaces do not precisely synchronize on repeated cycles of operation.

abstract = {Traditionally, system prognostics and health management (PHM) depends on sufficient prior knowledge of critical components degradation process in order to predict the remaining useful life (RUL). However, the accurate physical or expert models are not available in most cases. This paper proposes a new data-driven approach for prognostics using deep convolution neural networks (DCNN). Time window approach is employed for sample preparation in order for better feature extraction by DCNN. Raw collected data with normalization are directly used as inputs to the proposed network, and no prior expertise on prognostics and signal processing is required, that facilitates the application of the proposed method. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, experiments on the popular C-MAPSS dataset for aero-engine unit prognostics are carried out. High prognostic accuracy on the RUL estimation is achieved. The superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparisons with other popular approaches and the state-of-the-art results on the same dataset. The results of this study suggest that the proposed data-driven prognostic method offers a new and promising approach.},

Recently, with the advent of emerging Information Communication Technologies (ICTs), we can get the visibility of asset status information during its usage period. It gives us new challenging issues for improving the efficiency of asset operations. One issue is to implement the Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) approach that makes a diagnosis of the asset status based on wire or wireless monitored data, predicts the assets abnormality, and executes suitable maintenance actions such as repair and replacement before serious problems happen. In this study, we have addressed several aspects of CBM approach: definition, related international standards, procedure, and techniques with the introduction of some relevant case studies that we have carried out.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare the noise and vibration levels associated with three hand-held rock drills (pneumatic, hydraulic and electric) currently used in South African mines, and a prototype acoustically shielded self-propelled rock drill. METHODS: Equivalent A-weighted sound pressure levels were recorded on a geometrical grid, using Rion NL-11 and NL-14 sound level meters. Vibration measurements were conducted on the pneumatic, hydraulic and electric drills in accordance with the ISO5349-1 (2001) international standard on human exposure to hand-transmitted vibration, using a Brupsilonel and Kjaer UA0894 hand adaptor. PCB Piezo accelerometers were used to measure vibration in three orthogonal directions. No vibration measurements were conducted on the self-propelled drill. RESULTS: All four drills emitted noise exceeding 85 dB(A). The pneumatic drill reached levels of up to 114 dB(A), while the shielded self-propelled drill almost complied with the 85 dB(A) 8 h exposure limit. Vibration levels of up to 31 m s(-2) were recorded. These levels greatly exceed recommended and legislated levels. CONCLUSIONS: Significant engineering advances will need to be made in the manufacture of rock drills to impact on noise induced hearing loss and hand arm vibration syndrome. Isolating the operator from the drill, as for the self-propelled drill, addresses the problems of both vibration and noise exposure, and is a possible direction for future development.},

However, due to the fact that in real world industrial applications, the working load is changing all the time and noise from the working environment is inevitable, degradation of the performance of intelligent fault diagnosis methods is very serious. In this paper, a new model based on deep learning is proposed to address the problem. Our contributions of include: First, we proposed an end-to-end method that takes raw temporal signals as inputs and thus doesn't need any time consuming denoising preprocessing. The model can achieve pretty high accuracy under noisy environment. Second, the model does not rely on any domain adaptation algorithm or require information of the target domain. It can achieve high accuracy when working load is changed. To understand the proposed model, we will visualize the learned features, and try to analyze the reasons behind the high performance of the model.},

abstract = {Multivariate methods often serve as an intelligent way to study the relations between two data sets. When the number of variables in one or both data sets is large, which is usually the case, the correlation matrices of the data sets may be singular or ill-conditioned. When this happens the weights obtained by multivariate methods that require the inversion of the correlation matrices are not unique, or highly unreliable. Here we present and apply a robust estimation and forecasting method that does not require us to invert the correlation matrices. This method, which we call robust canonical analysis (RCA), is a straightforward extension of the simple covariance of two variables to two data sets. As an example we use the RCA method to estimate the relations between a set of measures that describe how the firm manages its relations with its customers, and a set of variables that describe the utility of information systems applications to the firm's operations. Scope and purpose Researchers often employ multivariate analysis when they need to represent a very large data set by several easy-to-interpret variables, or when it is necessary to relate one set of variables to another. These methods facilitate identification of effects of key variables of one data set on all or several of the variables in the other data set. Thus, they can also be used as data reduction methods. Depending on the particular application and the available data, a multivariate method serves either as the first stage of the quantitative analysis, or as the true representation of the theoretical model. In this study we present a multivariate generalization of covariance as a first-order approximation to the true relations between two large data sets that may exhibit severe multicollinearity among the variables.},

abstract = {Recent developments in the condition monitoring and asset management market have led to the commercialisation of online vibration-monitoring systems. These systems are primarily utilised to monitor large mineral mining equipment such as draglines, continuous miners and hydraulic shovels. Online monitoring systems make diagnostic information continuously available for asset management, production outsourcing and maintenance alliances with equipment manufacturers. However, most online vibration-monitoring systems are based on conventional vibration-monitoring technologies, which are prone to giving false equipment deterioration warnings on gears that operate under fluctuating load conditions. A simplified mathematical model of a gear system was developed to illustrate the feasibility of monitoring the instantaneous angular speed (IAS) as a means of monitoring the condition of gears that are subjected to fluctuating load conditions. A distinction is made between cyclic stationary load modulation and non-cyclic stationary load modulation. It is shown that rotation domain averaging will suppress the modulation caused by non-cyclic stationary load conditions but will not suppress the modulation caused by cyclic stationary load conditions. An experimental investigation on a test rig indicated that the IAS of a gear shaft could be monitored with a conventional shaft encoder to indicate a deteriorating gear fault condition. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Issue Title: Special Issues: "Machinery Health Monitoring, Diagnosis and Prognosis" and "Condition-Based Maintenance: Theory and Applications" In condition based maintenance (CBM) optimization, the main optimization objectives include maximizing reliability and minimizing maintenance costs, which are often times conflicting to each other. In this work, we develop a physical programming based approach to deal with the multi-objective condition based maintenance optimization problem. Physical programming presents two major advantages: (1) it is an efficient approach to capture the decision makers' preferences on the objectives by eliminating the iterative process of adjusting the weights of the objectives, and (2) it is easy to use in that decision makers just need to specify physically meaningful boundaries for the objectives. The maintenance cost and reliability objectives are calculated based on proportional hazards model and a control limit CBM replacement policy. With the proposed approach, the decision maker can systematically and efficiently make good tradeoff between the cost objective and reliability objective. An example is used to illustrate the proposed approach.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {Many different methods have been developed for the measurement of angular speed. Each successive method has attempted to improve measurement performance using a different strategy to process encoder signals based on two basic principles: counting the number of pulses in a given time duration and measuring the elapsed time for a single cycle of encoder signal. A review of existing methods reveals that little effort has been made in the measurement of instantaneous, multi-channel, wide-range angular speed. As a result, this paper aims to develop a method that provides instantaneous speed information in the form of angular displacement. It addresses the general process and considerations that ensure effective measurement of instantaneous angular speed (IAS). The paper then presents two different techniques: one is based on a general-purpose data acquisition system, another uses pure software implementation. Both methods aim to maximise the use of hardware resources without incurring additional costs in the form of upgrades to the measurement system. Finally, an optimisation of measurement system parameters for a reliable IAS measurement has been carried out based on measurement error analysis. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Much research has been conducted in prognostics and health management (PHM), an emerging field in mechanical engineering that is gaining interest from both academia and industry. Most of these efforts have been in the area of machinery PHM, resulting in the development of many algorithms for this particular application. The majority of these algorithms concentrate on applications involving common rotary machinery components, such as bearings and gears. Knowledge of this prior work is a necessity for any future research efforts to be conducted; however, there has not been a comprehensive overview that details previous and on-going efforts in PHM. In addition, a systematic method for developing and deploying a PHM system has yet to be established. Such a method would enable rapid customization and integration of PHM systems for diverse applications. To address these gaps, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the PHM field, followed by an introduction of a systematic PHM design methodology, 5S methodology, for converting data to prognostics information. This methodology includes procedures for identifying critical components, as well as tools for selecting the most appropriate algorithms for specific applications. Visualization tools are presented for displaying prognostics information in an appropriate fashion for quick and accurate decision making. Industrial case studies are included in this paper to show how this methodology can help in the design of an effective PHM system.},

abstract = {Gears are one of the most common mechanisms for transmitting power and motion and their usage can be found in numerous applications. Studies on gear teeth contacts have been considered as one of the most complicated applications in tribology. Depending on the application, the speed and load conditions of teeth may change triggering several types of failures on teeth surface such as wear, scuffing, micro-pitting and pitting. The above-mentioned faults influence changes in vibration and acoustic signals, due to changes in operating conditions such as increase in temperature and decrease in lubricant film thickness and specific film thickness. These abnormal changes result in cumulative effects on localised or distributed faults on load bearing surfaces of gears. Such damages cause reduction in tooth stiffness and severity of damage can be assessed by evaluating the same using vibration-based signals. This paper presents the results of experimental investigations carried out to assess wear in spur gears of back-to-back gearbox under accelerated test conditions. The studies considered the estimation of operating conditions such as film thickness and their effects on the fault growth on teeth surface. Modal testing experiments have been carried out on the same gear starting from healthy to worn out conditions to quantify wear damage. The results provide a good understanding of dependent roles of gearbox operating conditions and vibration parameters as measures for effective assessment of wear in spur gears. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {In this paper, an interesting observation on the noise-dependent performance of prognostics algorithms is presented. A method of evaluating the accuracy of prognostics algorithms without having the true degradation model is proposed. This paper compares the four most widely used model-based prognostics algorithms, i.e., Bayesian method, particle filter, Extended Kalman filter, and nonlinear least squares, to illustrate the effect of random noise in data on the performance of prediction. The mean squared error (MSE) that measures the difference between the true damage size and the predicted one is used to rank the four algorithms for each dataset. We found that the randomness in the noise leads to a very different ranking of the algorithms for different datasets, even though they are all from the same damage model. In particular, even for the algorithm that has the best performance on average, poor results can be obtained for some datasets. In absence of true damage information, we propose another metric, mean squared discrepancy (MSD), which measures the difference between the prediction and the data. A correlation study between MSE and MSD indicates that MSD can be used to estimate the ranking of the four prognostics algorithms without having the true damage information. Moreover, the best algorithm selected by MSD has a high probability of also having the smallest prediction error when used for predicting beyond the last measurement. MSD can thus be particularly useful for selecting the best algorithm for predicting into the near future for a given set of measurements.},

abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different “thinned” networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

abstract = {All assets necessarily suffer wear and tear during operation. Prognostics can assess the current health of a system and predict its remaining life based on features capturing the gradual degradation of its operational capabilities. Prognostics are critical to improve safety, plan successful work, schedule maintenance, and reduce maintenance costs and down time. Prognosis is a relatively new area but has become an important part of Condition-based Maintenance (CBM) of systems. As there are many prognostic techniques, usage must be acceptable to particular applications. Broadly stated, prognostic methods are either data-driven, rule based, or model-based. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages; consequently, they are often combined in hybrid applications. A hybrid model can combine some or all model types; thus, more complete information can be gathered, leading to more accurate recognition of the fault state. In this context, it is also important to evaluate the consistency and the reliability of the measurement data obtained during laboratory testing activity and the prognostic/diagnostic monitoring of the system under examination. This approach is especially relevant in systems where the maintainer and operator know some of the failure mechanisms with sufficient amount of data, but the sheer complexity of the assets precludes the development of a complete model-based approach. This paper addresses the process of data aggregation into a contextual awareness hybrid model to get Residual Useful Life (RUL) values within logical confidence intervals so that the life cycle of assets can be managed and optimised.},

abstract = {The use of condition monitoring techniques in industry to direct maintenance actions has increased rapidly over recent years to the extent that it has marked the beginning of what is likely to prove a new generation in production and main-tenance management practice. There are both economic and technological reasons for this development driven by tight profit margins, high outage costs and an increase in plant complexity and automation. Technical advances in condition monitoring techniques have provided a means to achieve high availability and to reduce scheduled and unscheduled production shutdowns. In all cases, the measured condition information does, in addition to potentially improving decision making, have a value added role for a manager in that there is now a more ob-jective means of explaining actions if challenged. In November 1979, the consultants, Michael Neal {\&} Associate Ltd published 'A Guide to Condition Monitoring of Machinery' for the UK Department of Trade and Industry; Neal et al. (1979). This groundbreaking report illustrated the difference in maintenance strategies (e.g., breakdown, planned, etc.) and suggested that condition based maintenance, using a range of techniques, would offer significant benefits to industry. By the late 1990s condition based maintenance had become widely accepted as one of the drivers to reduce maintenance costs and increase plant availability. With the advent of e-procurement, business to business (B2B), customer to business (C2B), business to customer (B2C) etc., industry is fast moving towards enterprise wide information systems associated with the internet. Today, plant asset management is the integration of computerised maintenance management systems and condition monitoring in order to fulfil the business objectives. This enables significant production benefits through objective maintenance prediction and scheduling. This positions the manufacturer to remain competitive in a dynamic market. Today there exists a large and growing variety of condition monitoring tech-niques for machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. A particularly popular 112 W. Wang one for rotating and reciprocal machinery is vibration analysis. However, irrespective of the particular condition monitoring technique used, the working principle of condition monitoring is the same, namely condition data become available which need to be interpreted and appropriate actions taken accordingly. There are generally two stages in condition based maintenance. The first stage is related to condition monitoring data acquisition and their technical interpretations. There have been numerous papers contributing to this stage, as evidenced by the proceedings of COMADEM over recent years. This stage is characterised by engineering skill, knowledge and experience. Much effort of the study at this stage has gone into determining the appropriate variables to monitor, Chen et al. (1994), the design of systems for condition monitoring data acquisition, Drake et al. (1995), signal processing, Wong et al. (2006), Samanta et al. (2006), Harrison (1995), Li and Li (1995), and how to implement computerised condition monitoring, Meher-Homji et al. (1994). These are just a few examples and no modelling is explicitly entered into the maintenance decision process based upon the results of condition monitoring. For detailed technical aspects of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis, see Collacott (1997). The second stage is maintenance decision making, namely what to do now given that condition information data and their interpretations are available. The decision at this stage can be complicated and entails consideration of cost, downtime, production demand, preventive maintenance shutdown windows, and most im-portantly, the likely survival time of the item monitored. Compared with the exten-sive literature on condition monitoring techniques and their applications, relatively little attention has been paid to the important problem of modelling appropriate decision making in condition based maintenance. This chapter focuses on the second stage of condition monitoring, namely condition based maintenance modeling as an aid to effective decision making. In particular, we will highlight a modelling technique used recently in condition based maintenance, e.g. residual life modelling via stochastic filtering (Wang and Christer 2000). This is a key element in modeling the decision making aspect of condition based maintenance. The chapter is organised as follows. Section 5.2 gives a brief introduction to condition monitoring techniques. Section 5.3 focuses on condition based maintenance modeling and discuss various modeling tech-niques used. Section 5.4 presents the modelling of the residual life conditional on observed monitoring information using stochastic filtering. Section 5.5 concludes the chapter with a discussion of topics for future research.},

This paper describes an experimental investigation on spur gears in which natural pitting was allowed to occur. Throughout the test period, AE, vibration and spectrometric oil samples were monitored continuously in order to correlate and compare these techniques to natural life degradation of the gears. It was observed that based on the analysis of root mean square (rms) levels only the AE technique was more sensitive in detecting and monitoring pitting than either the vibration or spectrometric oil analysis (SOA) techniques. It is concluded that as AE exhibited a direct relationship with pitting progression, it offers the opportunity for prognosis. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Structural and machinery failures in the day-to-day ship operations may lead to major accidents, endangering crew and passengers onboard, posing a threat to the environment, damaging the ship itself and having a great impact in terms of business losses. In this respect, this paper presents the INCASS (Inspection Capabilities for Enhanced Ship Safety) project which aims bringing an innovative solution to the ship inspection regime through the introduction of enhanced inspection of ship structures, by integrating robotic-automated platforms for on-line or on-demand ship inspection activities and selecting the software and hardware tools that can implement or facilitate specific inspection tasks, to provide input to the Decision Support System (DSS). Enhanced inspection of ships will also include ship structures and machinery monitoring with real time information using 'intelligent' sensors and incorporating structural and machinery risk analysis, using in-house structural/hydrodynamics and machinery computational tools. Moreover, condition based inspection tools and methodologies, reliability and criticality based maintenance are introduced. An enhanced central database handles ship structures and machinery data. The data is available to ship operators and are utilized by the DSS for ship structures and machinery for continuous monitoring and risk analysis of ship operations. The development and implementation of the INCASS system is shown in the case of a machinery system of a tanker ship. In this way the validation and testing of the INCASS framework will be achieved in realistic operational conditions.},

A monitoring system is designed in Android-based smartphone where it receives sensory data via wireless sensor network and further processes the data to indicate the current driving aptitude of the driver. It is critical that several sensors are integrated and synchronized for a more realistic evaluation of the driver behavior. The sensors applied include a video sensor to capture the driver image and a bio-signal sensor to gather the driver photoplethysmograph signal. A dynamic Bayesian network framework is used for the driver fatigue evaluation. A warning alarm is sounded if driver fatigue is believed to reach a defined threshold. The manifold testing of the system demonstrates the practical use of multiple features, particularly with discrete methods, and their fusion enables a more authentic and ample fatigue detection.},

abstract = {We present a conceptual framework and the computational tools to study the value of the material responses in designing material characterization tests to identify the material model under uncertainty. A computational framework is first developed to estimate the information gained by observing a material response as a measure of the value of the experiment. The proposed framework is then extended to estimate the mutual information between the material response space and the material model space as a basis for ranking the available material response candidates as they relate to reducing the uncertainty of the inferred model. We then define a design problem where a tunable parameter, referred to as the design parameter, is identified so as to render two different material responses to be of the same value from an information content point of view. We finally study the value of the material responses, obtained in a spherical indentation test, i.e. reaction force-indenter displacement, maximum indentation load and the residual imprint, where it is shown that the proposed framework offers a computationally affordable and uncertainty-aware platform to design material characterization tests.},

abstract = {Designing of mechanical parts covers many basic aspects of mechanical engineering. Coupling a proper choice of material and surface treatment, the static and the dynamic designing follow well consolidated criteria, often suggested by experience or prescribed by standards. In gear design many efforts are planned to extend life against wear and contact fatigue, hence the main role is played by a proper selection of surface hardening methods.Complex phenomena of failure are involved for such components during their working life, therefore a deeper comprehension of the damaging mechanisms is necessary to prevent them. To this aim a particular case of failure analysis of a pinion gear is considered. It was built in 18NiCrMo5 UNI 7846 case-carburized, quench hardened and tempered steel. By very few working cycles, the transmission gear prematurely failed. Several ruptures on teeth were noticeable to the unaided eye which covered either a small area of the tooth flank (near the root fillet) or a large zone of the flank itself. In any case, the failure involved only upper part of the pinion teeth. A detailed investigation was needed to clarify the reasons of such a premature rupture. The root of failure was determined to be external overloading and the initial stage of the damage was close related to complex surface contact fatigue mechanism. Following on this investigation the effect of carburising was studied in relation to the mechanism of failure and analternative nitriding treatment was considered to solve this problem. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {One common form of real-world data is that of time series, where we observe one or more variables at a number of different times. Examples include measurements of temperature at one or more locations, the prices of stocks on the stock market, measurements from an elec-trocardiogram of a patient's heart beats, etc. We need appropriate models for this kind of data. This note provides a short introduction to AR, MA and ARMA models for time series data (see below for definitions). Chatfield (1989) and Diggle (1990) are useful introductory textbooks in this area; Brockwell and Davis (1991) is a more advanced text. A stochastic process can be described as " a statistical phenomenon that evolves in time according to probabilistic laws " (Chatfield, 1989, p. 27). Mathematically a stochastic process is a family of random variables X(t), where t runs over an index set, which for time series can be taken either as the real line, or to run over the integers (for a discrete-time process). We can think of generating an infinite set of times series (an ensemble) from a stochastic process, and that the observed time series is a possible realization of the stochastic process. We define the mean function µ(t) = E[X(t)], and the autocovariance function $\gamma$(t, s) = E[(X(t) − µ(t))(X(s) − µ(s))] of the stochastic process. A time series is said to be strictly stationary if the joint distribution of X(t 1), . . . , X(t n) is the same as the joint distribution of X(t 1 + $\tau$), . . . , X(t n + $\tau$) for all t 1 , . . . , t n , $\tau$ . A time series is said to be weakly stationary if its mean is constant and its autocovariance function depends only on the lag, i.e. E[X(t)] = µ ∀ t, Cov[X(t)X(t + $\tau$)] = $\gamma$($\tau$). A special kind of stochastic process is a Gaussian process, which is a family of random variables, any finite number of which have a joint Gaussian distribution. Below we will consider stationary Gaussian processes, which are one of the most widely used time series models. 1 AR, MA and ARMA models The three kinds of process you need to know about are called autoregressive (AR) models, moving average (MA) models, and autoregressive/moving average (ARMA) models; we discuss these in the following sections. 1 (a) (b) Figure 1: Simulations of an AR(1) process for (a) $\alpha$ = 0.5 and (b) $\alpha$ = −0.5. 1.1 Autoregressive Models We start with the simple case known as an AR(1) model, with x t = $\alpha$x t−1 + w t , (1) where w t ∼ N (0, $\sigma$ 2) is a Gaussian random variable with mean zero and variance $\sigma$ 2 . The w's at different times are assumed independent, i.e. they are a white noise process. By repeated substitution we obtain x t = w t + $\alpha$w t−1 + $\alpha$ 2 w t−2 + . . . (2) which shows that E[X(t)] = 0, and if |$\alpha$| {\textless} 1 the process is stationary with variance},

In recent 20 years, production systems of advanced manufacturing paradigms (e.g. mass customization, reconfigurable manufacturing, sustainable manufacturing and service-oriented manufacturing) have been developed to exceed the traditional “mass production” paradigm. The reasons that make system health management especially difficult include individual machine deteriorations, different system structures, diverse production characteristics and exponential scheduling complexity. To address these gaps, we provide a review of the prognostics and health management (PHM) field focusing on prognostics approaches for asset health, and maintenance policies for more “informed” decisions. This paper addresses recent advances in PHM for advanced manufacturing paradigms to forecast health trends, avoid production breakdowns, reduce maintenance cost and achieve rapid decision-making.

This paper presents a vibration-based two-stage fault detection framework for failure diagnosis of rotating components in wind turbines. The proposed framework integrates an analytical defect detection method with a graphical verification method to ensure diagnosis efficiency and accuracy. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is demonstrated with a case study using the gearbox condition monitoring Round Robin study dataset provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The developed methodology successfully detected five faults out of a total of seven with accurate severity levels and without producing any false alarm in the blind analysis. The case study results indicate that the developed fault detection framework is effective for analyzing gear and bearing faults in wind turbine drivetrain systems based on system vibration characteristics.},

abstract = {Vibration can be monitored under fluctuating load conditions if provision is made for taking into account the fluctuation in machine speed, the response amplitude modulation caused by the change in input force, and the amplitude and phase effects on the measured response from the transmission path. Methodologies have been developed to compensate for the effects of fluctuating speed and amplitude modulation. However, this article investigates the effect of the transmission path phase. This is discussed in terms of the effect this phase has on synchronous averaging. A new approach is presented to resolve the influence that the transmission path phase has on synchronous averaging. The approach is used for the experimental data measured on a helical gear test rig. A significant improvement in the rate of convergence was obtained by adopting the new approach which compensates for the phase shifting in the measured structural response. This contrasts with conventional synchronous averaging with order tracking which does not compensate for structural response phase shifting. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It takes into account the most important phenomena involved in the operation of this kind of machines. Two main sources of noise and vibration can be considered: pressure and gear meshing. Fluid pressure distribution on gears, which is time-varying, is computed and included as a resultant external force and torque acting on the gears. Parametric excitations due to time-varying meshing stiffness, the tooth profile errors (obtained by a metrological analysis), the backlash effects between meshing teeth, the lubricant squeeze and the possibility of tooth contact on both lines of action were also included. Finally, the torsional stiffness and damping of the driving shaft and the non-linear behaviour of the hydrodynamic journal bearings were also taken into account. Model validation was carried out on the basis of experimental data concerning case accelerations and force reactions. The model can be used in order to analyse the pump dynamic behaviour and to identify the effects of modifications in design and operation parameters, in terms of vibration and dynamic forces. Part I is devoted to the calculation of the gear eccentricity in the steady-state condition as result of the balancing between mean pressure loads, mean meshing force and bearing reactions, while in Part II the meshing phenomena are fully explained and the main simulation results are presented. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The research project reported on represents the first comprehensive attempt to measure the vibration levels of a variety of tools and equipment in the South African mining industry to determine the effect thereof on the health of workers and operators. Although human vibration has been studied extensively internationally only one reference pertaining to the South African mining industry could be found. From studies conducted in Canada and elsewhere it was evident that rock drills do have potentially hazardous levels of vibration. The scope of the research included measurements on a broad spectrum of tools, machines and vehicles used in the South African mining industry. Both hand-arm vibration, where the majority of the vibration enter the body through the hands, and whole body vibration, where the whole body is exposed to vibration through contact by the buttocks or feet, were investigated and measured. More than 700 sets of vibration data measured on 70 machines at 15 mines and workshops were obtained. Data were obtained for at least 24 different types of equipment and machines that were previously judged to have medium to high levels of vibration. All measurements were conducted in accordance with the international standards: ISO 5349, on hand-arm vibration, and ISO 2631-1, for whole body vibration. The equipment with the highest vibration levels in the hand-arm category was: rock drills, both pneumatic and hydraulic; pavement breakers and jackhammers; hand-held compactors; pneumatic wrenches and electrical hammer drills. Of these the rock drills had weighted vibration levels in excess of 20 m/s2. As far as whole body vibration was concerned the highest values were measured on earth-moving equipment. The major conclusion from this study is that the measured vibration levels are sufficiently high to create an enhanced level of risk of vibration-induced disorders in a significant proportion of the operators of hand-held equipment. The most notable examples are hand-held rock drills, pavement breakers, jackhammers and certain selected workshop tools. The results of the study indicate that a comprehensive epidemiological study should be undertaken on present and past workers to determine the prevalence of vibration-induced disorders.},

The estimation issue of the cyclic coherence is addressed in detail, as well as its use in a statistical test, and sub-optimal simplifications.

Field measurements have shown that the trailing inner wheels that squeal are subject to predominantly longitudinal creepage with little-to-no lateral creepage. The longitudinal creepage acting at the contact of the squealing wheels exceeds 1{\%}, which supports the likelihood of creep saturation and subsequent squealing due to unsteady longitudinal creepage in the large-radius curves. Experimental modal analysis of the wheel types identified to be relevant to squeal has revealed that for each unstable frequency, two eigenmodes are likely to be important: one that has a large mode shape component at the wheel-rail contact in the circumferential direction and another that has a large mode shape component at the wheel-rail contact in the radial direction. A frictional self-excitation mechanism based on mode-coupling is favoured as being responsible for squeal excited in large-radius curves.},

abstract = {In the analysis of hydrodynamic journal bearings, linearized stiffness and damping coefficients are widely used for the evaluation of stability and dynamic response characteristics. Under given operating conditions, these coefficients vary along the locus of the orbital response, and are not valid at large amplitudes (40{\%} of the bearing clearance) of the journal motion. The time history of journal bearing motion for large vibrations is accurately predicted herein using nonlinear (time-transient) analysis. This paper discusses the adequacy of bearing analysis based on linearized coefficients and presents the significance of variation of the coefficients under the dynamic conditions. A method to predict nonlinear dynamic coefficients using multiple regression analysis is presented and the results are validated the comparison with the nonlinear solution of Reynolds equation. The dynamic coefficients are evaluated based on the locus of the transient journal orbit using a third-order Taylor series expansion of bearing reactions. Also, the coefficients are predicted for a journal orbit, as the nonlinearity depends on the size and shape of the orbit. The journal center orbit is obtained using a transient simulation technique, involving the combined solution of Reynolds equation and the rotor equations of motion. The nonlinear dynamic coefficients are analyzed for a two-axial groove bearing to investigate the acceptable limits of linear bearing coefficients. The percentage variation of the ratio of a dynamic coefficients indicates that the bearing nonlinearity is predominant at lower eccentricity ratios. {\textcopyright} 2001 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {A hybrid two stage one-against-all Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach is proposed for the automated diagnosis of defective rolling element bearings. The basic concept and major advantage of the method, is that its training can be performed using simulation data, which result from a well established model, describing the dynamic response of defective rolling element bearings. Then, vibration measurements, resulting from the machine under condition monitoring, can be imported and processed directly by the already trained SVM, eliminating thus the need of training the SVM with experimental data of the specific defective bearing. A key aspect of the method is the data preprocessing approach, which among others, includes order analysis, in order to overcome problems related to sudden changes of the shaft rotating speed. Moreover, frequency domain features both from the raw signal as well as from the demodulated signal are used as inputs to the SVM classifiers for a two-stage recognition and classification procedure. At the first stage, a SVM classifier separates the normal condition signals from the faulty signals. At the second stage, a SVM classifier recognizes and categorizes the type of the fault. The effectiveness of the method tested in one literature established experimental test case and in three different industrial test cases, including a total number of 34 measurements. Each test case includes successive measurements from bearings under different types of defects, different loads and different rotation speeds. In all cases, the method presents 100{\%} classification success. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Vibration analysis of rotating machinery is an important part of industrial predictive maintenance programmes, so that wear and defects in moving parts can be discovered and repaired before the machine breaks down, thus reducing operating and maintenance costs. One method of vibration analysis is known as order tracking. This is a frequency analysis method that uses multiples of the running speed (orders), instead of absolute frequencies (Hz), as the frequency base. Order tracking is useful for machine condition monitoring because it can easily identify speed-related vibrations such as shaft defects and bearing wear. To use order tracking analysis, the vibration signal must be sampled at constant increments of shaft angle. Conventional order tracking data acquisition uses special analog hardware to sample at a rate proportional to the shaft speed. A computed order tracking method samples at a constant rate (i.e. uniform $\Delta$t), and then uses software to resample the data at constant angular increments. This study examines which factors and assumptions, inherent in this computed order tracking method, have the greatest effect on its accuracy. Both classical and computed methods were evaluated and compared using a digital simulation. It was found that the method is extremely sensitive to the timing accuracy of the keyphasor pulses and that great improvements in the spectral accuracy were observed when making use of higher-order interpolation functions.},

abstract = {Demodulation is very important for gear fault detection. However, the demodulation is substantially complicated by the non-stationary nature of the signal during the speed-up and speed-down processes. As such, we propose a new technique to detect gear faults under such conditions based on the multi-scale chirplet path pursuit (MSCPP) algorithm and the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) method. With the MSCPP algorithm, the instantaneous frequency of the signal component with the largest energy in the multi-components gear vibration signal can be estimated. Then according to the estimated instantaneous frequency, the vibration signal segment whose instantaneous frequency curve approximated as either an ascending or descending linear segment can be obtained from the original gear vibration signal. In other words, the vibration signal segment that can be regarded as a multi-component linear frequency modulated (LFM) signal is extracted. As the FrFT is suitable for multi-component LFM signal analysis, it is then applied to demodulating this vibration signal segment and hence detecting local gear faults based on the revealed modulation phenomenon. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been demonstrated by both simulation and experimental data.},

abstract = {This paper presents a simulation model for a gearbox test rig, in which a range of bearing faults can be implemented. Bearing faults sometimes manifest themselves by their interaction with meshing gears, and to simulate this it is necessary to model a whole system of gears and shafts supported in bearings. This has now been done for an experimental test rig through the incorporation of a time-varying, non-linear stiffness bearing model into a previously developed gear model. The incorporated bearing model is based on Hertzian contact theory, which relates the raceway displacement to the bearing load, and also accounts for the slippage between the elements. It has the capacity to model localised spalls (inner race, outer race and rolling elements), which are discussed in this part of the paper and extended inner and outer race faults (rough surfaces), which are discussed in part II. Even though the whole gearbox has not been modelled in detail, the non-linear time-varying gear-meshing operation is modelled in some detail. Both simulated and experimental localised fault signals (acceleration signals) were subjected to the same diagnostic techniques; namely spectrum comparisons, Spectral Kurtosis (SK) analysis and envelope analysis. The processed simulated signals showed a similar pattern to that observed in their measured counterparts and were found to have a characteristic, referred to in the literature as double pulses, corresponding to entry into and exit from the localised fault. The simulation model will be useful for producing typical fault signals from gearboxes to test new diagnostic algorithms, and possibly prognostic algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent, while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {The Kurtogram is based on the kurtosis of temporal signals that are filtered by the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), and has proved useful in the diagnosis of bearing faults. To extract transient impulsive signals more effectively, wavelet packet transform is regarded as an alternative method to STFT for signal decomposition. Although kurtosis based on temporal signals is effective under some conditions, its performance is low in the presence of a low signal-to-noise ratio and non-Gaussian noise. This paper proposes an enhanced Kurtogram, the major innovation of which is kurtosis values calculated based on the power spectrum of the envelope of the signals extracted from wavelet packet nodes at different depths. The power spectrum of the envelope of the signals defines the sparse representation of the signals and kurtosis measures the protrusion of the sparse representation. This enhanced Kurtogram helps to determine the location of resonant frequency bands for further demodulation with envelope analysis. The frequency signatures of the envelope signal can then be used to determine the type of fault that has affected a bearing by identifying its characteristic frequency. In many cases, discrete frequency noise always exists and may mask the weak bearing faults. It is usually preferable to remove such discrete frequency noise by using autoregressive filtering before the enhanced Kurtogram is performed. At last, we used a number of simulated bearing fault signals and three real bearing fault signals obtained from an experimental motor to validate the efficiency of these proposed modifications. The results show that both the proposed method and the enhanced Kurtogram are effective in the detection of various bearing faults. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In the proposed method, VKF is firstly adopted to remove the fault-unrelated components and give a clear representation of the fault symptoms. Second, the RCMFE is applied to extract fault features from the denoised vibration signal. Third, LS approach is introduced to refine the fault features by sorting the scale factors. In the end, the selected features are fed into the logistic regression (LR) to automatically complete the fault pattern identifications.

abstract = {The technique of machinery fault diagnosis has been greatly enhanced over recent years with the application of many pattern classification methods. However, these classification methods suffer from the "curse of dimensionality"; when applied to high-dimensional fault diagnosis data. In order to solve the problem, this paper proposes a hybrid model which combines multiple feature selection models to select the most significant input features from all potentially relevant features. Among the models, eight filter models are used to pre-rank the candidate features. They include data variance, Pearson correlation coefficient, the Relief algorithm, Fisher score, class separability, chi-squared, information gain and gain ratio. These variable ranking models measure features from various perspectives, and lead to different ranking results. Based on the effect of the ranking results on the Radial Basis Function (RBF) classification, a weighted voting scheme is then introduced to re-rank features. Furthermore, two wrapper models, a Binary Search (BS) model and a Sequential Backward Search (SBS) model are utilized to minimize the number of relevant features. To demonstrate the potential for applying the method to machinery fault diagnosis, two case studies are discussed. The experiment results support the conclusion that this method is useful for revealing fault-related frequency features. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

In modern manufacturing systems, data-driven machine health monitoring is gaining in popularity due to the widespread deployment of low-cost sensors and their connection to the Internet. Meanwhile, deep learning provides useful tools for processing and analyzing these big machinery data. The main purpose of this paper is to review and summarize the emerging research work of deep learning on machine health monitoring. After the brief introduction of deep learning techniques, the applications of deep learning in machine health monitoring systems are reviewed mainly from the following aspects: Auto-encoder (AE) and its variants, Restricted Boltzmann Machines and its variants including Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). In addition, an experimental study on the performances of these approaches has been conducted, in which the data and code have been online. Finally, some new trends of DL-based machine health monitoring methods are discussed.},

abstract = {With the increasing availability of large amounts of real-time process data and a better fundamental understanding of the operation of mineral processing units, statistical monitoring of mineral processing plants is becoming increasingly widespread. Process plants are typically too complex to model from first principles and therefore models based on historical process data are used instead. Multivariate methods such as principal component analysis are indispensable in these analyses and in this paper, it is shown how the statistical analysis of process data from a grinding circuit and a sound fundamental knowledge of the operation of mineral processing plants complement one another. For this purpose a philosophy for the statistical monitoring and cause and effect analysis of a process was outlined. It was shown how a well defined process hierarchy with complementing performance measures can effectively be used to detect a shift in the operation of a mineral processing plant and find the root cause of the shift. Visualisation of the results was found fundamental in communicating the findings of the statistical analysis to the processing plant. This resulted in the requirement for multidimensional visualisation of the process for which principal component analysis plots and process performance graphs in the form of two-dimensional histogram plots and parallel plots were found to be the most effective. Data availability, process variable selection, process hierarchy definition and performance measure selection were also found to be critical factors directly impacting on the success of statistically monitoring a process. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Rotating machinery covers a broad range of mechanical equipment and plays a significant role in industrial applications. It generally operates under tough working environment and is therefore subject to faults, which could be detected and diagnosed by using signal processing techniques. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is one of the most powerful signal processing techniques and has been extensively studied and widely applied in fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Numerous publications on the use of EMD for fault diagnosis have appeared in academic journals, conference proceedings and technical reports. This paper attempts to survey and summarize the recent research and development of EMD in fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, providing comprehensive references for researchers concerning with this topic and helping them identify further research topics. First, the EMD method is briefly introduced, the usefulness of the method is illustrated and the problems and the corresponding solutions are listed. Then, recent applications of EMD to fault diagnosis of rotating machinery are summarized in terms of the key components, such as rolling element bearings, gears and rotors. Finally, the outstanding open problems of EMD in fault diagnosis are discussed and potential future research directions are identified. It is expected that this review will serve as an introduction of EMD for those new to the concepts, as well as a summary of the current frontiers of its applications to fault diagnosis for experienced researchers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The challenge in many production activities involving large mechanical devices like power transmissions consists in reducing the machine downtime, in managing repairs and in improving operating time. Most online monitoring systems are based on conventional vibration measurement devices for gear transmissions or bearings in mechanical components. In this paper, we propose an alternative way of bearing condition monitoring based on the instantaneous angular speed measurement. By the help of a large experimental investigation on two different applications, we prove that localized faults like pitting in bearing generate small angular speed fluctuations which are measurable with optical or magnetic encoders. We also emphasize the benefits of measuring instantaneous angular speed with the pulse timing method through an implicit angular sampling which ensures insensitivity to speed fluctuation. A wide range of operating conditions have been tested for the two applications with varying speed, load, external excitations, gear ratio, etc. The tests performed on an automotive gearbox or on actual operating vehicle wheels also establish the robustness of the proposed methodology. By the means of a conventional Fourier transform, angular frequency channels kinematically related to the fault periodicity show significant magnitude differences related to the damage severity. Sideband effects are evidently seen when the fault is located on rotating parts of the bearing due to load modulation. Additionally, slip effects are also suspected to be at the origin of enlargement of spectrum peaks in the case of double row bearings loaded in a pure radial direction. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The increased clearance could induce contacts and impacts in joints, and consequently affect control accuracy. A nonlinear dynamic model of planetary gears with multi-clearance coupling is proposed in the current study to investigate the mechanism of influence of clearance on the dynamic performance. In addition, the coupling relationship between radial clearance and backlash is integrated into the multi-body system dynamics. The vibration characteristics of planetary gears with the changes of rotational velocity, clearance size and inertia load are explored. The numerical simulation results show that there are complex coupling relations in planetary gear systems, due to the multi-clearance coupling. The phenomenon of system resonance may occur with the changes of rotational velocities and clearances' sizes. Multi-clearance coupling can significantly increase the resonant response of planetary gear systems in empty-load or light-load states.},

abstract = {Machinery prognosis is the forecast of the remaining operational life, future condition, or probability of reliable operation of an equipment based on the acquired condition monitoring data. This approach to modern maintenance practice promises to reduce downtime, spares inventory, maintenance costs, and safety hazards. Given the significance of prognostics capabilities and the maturity of condition monitoring technology, there have been an increasing number of publications on rotating machinery prognostics in the past few years. These publications covered a wide spectrum of prognostics techniques. This review article first synthesises and places these individual pieces of information in context, while identifying their merits and weaknesses. It then discusses the identified challenges, and in doing so, alerts researchers to opportunities for conducting advanced research in the field. Current methods for predicting rotating machinery failures are summarised and classified as conventional reliability models, condition-based prognostics models and models integrating reliability and prognostics. Areas in need of development or improvement include the integration of condition monitoring and reliability, utilisation of incomplete trending data, consideration of effects from maintenance actions and variable operating conditions, derivation of the non-linear relationship between measured data and actual asset health, consideration of failure interactions, practicability of requirements and assumptions, as well as development of performance evaluation frameworks.

Users can also connect with one another, and subscribe to or become a fan or a follower of others. These diverse activities result in a multi-dimensional network among actors, forming group structures with group members sharing similar interests or affiliations. This work systematically addresses two challenges. First, it is challenging to effectively integrate interactions over multiple dimensions to discover hidden community structures shared by heterogeneous interactions.We show that representative community detection methods for single-dimensional networks can be presented in a unified view. Based on this unified view, we present and analyze four possible integration strategies to extend community detection from single-dimensional to multi-dimensional networks. In particular, we propose a novel integration scheme based on structural features. Another challenge is the evaluation of different methods without ground truth information about community membership.We employ a novel cross-dimension network validation procedure to compare the performance of different methods. We use synthetic data to deepen our understanding, and real-world data to compare integration strategies as well as baseline methods in a large scale. We study further the computational time of different methods, normalization effect during integration, sensitivity to related parameters, and alternative community detection methods for integration.},

abstract = {The method for computer aided tooth contact analysis in mismatched spiral bevel gears is applied for the investigation of the influence of misalignments of the mating members and tooth errors on mesh performances. By using the corresponding computer program the influence of pinion's offset and pinion's adjustment error along the pinion and gear axis, angular position error of the pinion axis and tooth spacing error on the shape and position of path of contact and potential contact lines under load, on separations along the potential contact lines, on angular displacements of the driven gear member from the theoretically exact position based on the ratio of the numbers of teeth, and on the variation of the angular velocity ratio through a mesh cycle have been determined. The results obtained show that the position errors of the mating members worsen the conjugation of the contacting tooth surfaces, and considerably increase the angular displacements of the gear member and the velocity ratio variation through the whole mesh cycle, that considerably worsens the mesh performances. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Zio2008,
abstract = {Recent researches in fault classification have shown the importance of accurately selecting the features that have to be used as inputs to the diagnostic model. In this work, a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is considered for the feature selection phase. Then, two different techniques for using the selected features to develop the fault classification model are compared: a single classifier based on the feature subset with the best classification performance and an ensemble of classifiers working on different feature subsets. The motivation for developing ensembles of classifiers is that they can achieve higher accuracies than single classifiers. An important issue for an ensemble to be effective is the diversity in the predictions of the base classifiers which constitute it, i.e. their capability of erring on different sub-regions of the pattern space. In order to show the benefits of having diverse base classifiers in the ensemble, two different ensembles have been developed: in the first, the base classifiers are constructed on feature subsets found by MOGAs aimed at maximizing the fault classification performance and at minimizing the number of features of the subsets; in the second, diversity among classifiers is added to the MOGA search as the third objective function to maximize. In both cases, a voting technique is used to effectively combine the predictions of the base classifiers to construct the ensemble output. For verification, some numerical experiments are conducted on a case of multiple-fault classification in rotating machinery and the results achieved by the two ensembles are compared with those obtained by a single optimal classifier. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A new paradigm for machinery maintenance is emerging as preventive$\backslash$nmaintenance strategies are being replaced by condition-based$\backslash$nmaintenance. In condition-based maintenance, machinery is repaired or$\backslash$nserviced only when an intelligent monitoring system indicates that the$\backslash$nsystem cannot fulfill mission requirements. The implementation of such$\backslash$nsystems requires a combination of sensor data fusion, feature$\backslash$nextraction, classification, and prediction algorithms. In addition, new$\backslash$nsystem architectures are being developed to facilitate the reduction of$\backslash$nwide bandwidth sensor data to concise predictions of ability of the$\backslash$nsystem to complete its current mission or future missions. This paper$\backslash$ndescribes the system architecture, data fusion, and classification$\backslash$nalgorithms employed in a distributed, wireless bearing and gear health$\backslash$nmonitoring system. The role and integration of prognostic algorithms -$\backslash$nrequired to predict future system health - are also discussed.

abstract = {In this study, a nonlinear time-varying dynamic model is proposed to predict modulation sidebands of planetary gear sets. This discrete dynamic model includes periodically time-varying gear mesh stiffnesses and the nonlinearities associated with tooth separations. The model uses forms of gear mesh interface excitations that are amplitude and frequency modulated due to a class of gear manufacturing errors to predict dynamic forces at all sun-planet and ring-planet gear meshes. The predicted gear mesh force spectra are shown to exhibit well-defined modulation sidebands at frequencies associated with the rotational speeds of gears relative to the planet carrier. This model is further combined with a previously developed model that accounts for amplitude modulations due to rotation of the carrier to predict acceleration spectra at a fixed position in the planetary transmission housing. Individual contributions of each gear error in the form of amplitude and frequency modulations are illustrated through an example analysis. Comparisons are made to measured spectra to demonstrate the capability of the model in predicting the sidebands of a planetary gear set with gear manufacturing errors and a rotating carrier. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {When used for visualization of high-dimensional data, the self-organizing map (SOM) requires a coloring scheme, such as the U-matrix, to mark the distances between neurons. Even so, the structures of the data clusters may not be apparent and their shapes are often distorted. In this paper, a visualization-induced SOM (ViSOM) is proposed to overcome these shortcomings. The algorithm constrains and regularizes the inter-neuron distance with a parameter that controls the resolution of the map. The mapping preserves the inter-point distances of the input data on the map as well as the topology. It produces a graded mesh in the data space such that the distances between mapped data points on the map resemble those in the original space, like in the Sammon mapping. However, unlike the Sammon mapping, the ViSOM can accommodate both training data and new arrivals and is much simpler in computational complexity. Several experimental results and comparisons with other methods are presented.},

abstract = {Condition-based maintenance is nowadays considered as a key-process in maintenance strategies and prognostics appears to be a very promising activity as it should permit to not engage inopportune spending. Various approaches have been developed and data-driven methods are increasingly applied. The training step of these methods generally requires huge datasets since a lot of methods rely on probability theory and/or on artificial neural networks. This step is thus time-consuming and generally made in batch mode which can be restrictive in practical application when few data are available. A method for prognostics is proposed to face up this problem of lack of information and missing prior knowledge. The approach is based on the integration of three complementary modules and aims at predicting the failure mode early while the system can switch between several functioning modes. The three modules are: 1) observation selection based on information theory and Choquet Integral, 2) prediction relying on an evolving real-time neuro-fuzzy system and 3) classification into one of the possible functioning modes using an evidential Markovian classifier based on Dempster-Shafer theory. Experiments concern the prediction of an engine health based on more than twenty observations.},

abstract = {Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings (REBs) are at present very important to ensure the steadiness of industrial and domestic machinery. According to the non-stationary and nonlinear characteristics of REB vibration signals, feature extraction method is based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) energy entropy in this paper. A mathematical analysis to select the most significant intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) is presented. Therefore, the chosen features are used to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to classify bearings defects. Experimental results indicated that the proposed method based on run-to-failure vibration signals can reliably categorize bearing defects. Using a proposed health index (HI), REB degradations are perfectly detected with different defect types and severities. Experimental results consist in continuously evaluating the condition of the monitored bearing and thereby detect online the severity of the defect successfully. This paper shows potential application of ANN as effective tool for automatic bearing performance degradation assessment without human intervention. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To process this vast amount of information it is important to distinguish different clusters of related webpages. Such clusters are used, for example, for knowledge extraction, named entity recognition, and recommendation algorithms. A variety of applications (such as semantic analysis systems, crawlers and search engines) utilizes semantic clustering algorithms to recognize thematically connected webpages. The majority of them relies on text analysis of the web documents content, and this leads to certain limitations, such as long processing time, need of representative text content, or vagueness of natural language. In this article, we present a framework for unsupervised domain and language independent semantic clustering of the website, which utilizes its internal hypertext structure and does not require text analysis. As a basis, we represent the hypertext structure as a graph and apply known flow simulation clustering algorithms to the graph to produce a set of webpage clusters. We assume these clusters contain thematically connected webpages. We evaluate our clustering approach with a corpus of real-world webpages and compare the approach with well-known text document clustering algorithms.},

Prognostics enables the prediction of failures in machines resulting in benefits to plant operators such as shorter downtimes, higher operation reliability, reduced operations and maintenance cost, and more effective maintenance and logistics planning. Prognostic systems have been successfully deployed for the monitoring of relatively simple rotating machines. However, machines and associated systems today are increasingly complex. As such, there is an urgent need to develop prognostic techniques for such complex systems operating in the real world. This review paper focuses on prognostic techniques that can be applied to rotating machinery operating under non-linear and non-stationary conditions. The general concept of these techniques, the pros and cons of applying these methods, as well as their applications in the research field are discussed. Finally, the opportunities and challenges in implementing prognostic systems and developing effective techniques for monitoring machines operating under non-stationary and non-linear conditions are also discussed.},

Topics considered in detail include transducer selection and mounting location, recording and analysis instrumentation, and display formats and analysis tools (specifically, time domain, frequency domain, modal domain, and quefrency domain-based strategies). The discussion of fault detection is based primarily on standards and acceptance limits in the time and frequency domains. The discussion of fault diagnostics is divided into sections that focus on different forcing functions, specific machine components, specific machine types, and advanced diagnostic techniques.

abstract = {Cleaner production (CP) is considered as one of the most important means for manufacturing enterprises to achieve sustainable production and improve their sustainable competitive advantage. However, implementation of the CP strategy was facing barriers, such as the lack of complete data and valuable knowledge that can be employed to provide better support on decision-making of coordination and optimization on the product lifecycle management (PLM) and the whole CP process. Fortunately, with the wide use of smart sensing devices in PLM, a large amount of real-time and multi-source lifecycle big data can now be collected. To make better PLM and CP decisions based on these data, in this paper, an overall architecture of big data-based analytics for product lifecycle (BDA-PL) was proposed. It integrated big data analytics and service-driven patterns that helped to overcome the above-mentioned barriers. Under the architecture, the availability and accessibility of data and knowledge related to the product were achieved. Focusing on manufacturing and maintenance process of the product lifecycle, and the key technologies were developed to implement the big data analytics. The presented architecture was demonstrated by an application scenario, and some observations and findings were discussed in details. The results showed that the proposed architecture benefited customers, manufacturers, environment and even all stages of PLM, and effectively promoted the implementation of CP. In addition, the managerial implications of the proposed architecture for four departments were analyzed and discussed. The new CP strategy provided a theoretical and practical basis for the sustainable development of manufacturing enterprises.},

abstract = {For the efficient and reliable operation of automated machining processes, the implementation of suitable tool condition monitoring (TCM) strategy is required. Various monitoring systems, utilising sophisticated signal processing techniques, have been widely researched for a number of different processes. Most monitoring systems developed up to date employ force, acoustic emission and vibration, or a combination of these and other techniques with a sensor integration strategy. With this work, the implementation of a monitoring system utilising simultaneous vibration and strain measurements on the tool tip, is investigated for the wear of synthetic diamond tools which are specifically used for the manufacturing of aluminium pistons. Contrary to many of the earlier investigations, this work was conducted in a manufacturing environment, with the associated constraints such as the impracticality of direct measurement of the wear. Data from the manufacturing process was recorded with two piezoelectric strain sensors and an accelerometer, each coupled to a DSPT Siglab analyser. A large number of features indicative of tool wear were automatically extracted from different parts of the original signals. These included features from the time and frequency domains, time-series model coefficients (as features) and features extracted from wavelet packet analysis. A correlation coefficient approach was used to automatically select the best features indicative of the progressive wear of the diamond tools. The self-organising map (SOM) was employed to identify the tool state. The SOM is a type of neural network based on unsupervised learning. A near 100{\%} correct classification of the tool wear data was obtained by training the SOM with two independent data sets, and testing it with a third independent data set.},

abstract = {Maintenance is becoming more expensive nowadays due to the increased complexity in design and function of industrial systems. Continuous health monitoring is thus of high importance to increase the availability of industrial systems and consequently reduce the costs. This paper presents an algorithm for unsupervised trends extraction from multidimensional sensory data so as to use such trend in machinery health monitoring and maintenance needs. The proposed method does not assume any prior knowledge about the nature and type of the input signals. It is based on extracting successive multi-dimensional features from machinery sensory signals. Then, unsupervised feature selection on the features domain is applied without making any assumptions concerning the source of the signals and the number of the extracted features. Finally, empirical mode decomposition algorithm (EMD) is applied on the projected features with the purpose of following the evolution of data in a compact representation over time. The algorithm is demonstrated on accelerated degradation dataset of bearings acquired from PRONOSTIA experimental platform and a second dataset acquired form NASA repository where it is shown to be able to extract interesting signal trends. {\textcopyright} 2012 IFAC.},

abstract = {Fixed transducers often are used to monitor meshing gear pairs in order to detect tooth damage. A simple frequency-domain damage-detection algorithm is suggested for very early detection of such damage. Ratios of rotational-harmonic amplitudes computed from before and after potential damage are utilized to eliminate effects of transducer and structural-path-caused amplitude changes between tooth-meshing location and transducer output, to minimize attenuating effects of multiple-tooth contact, and thereby, to approximately equally weight rotational-harmonic amplitudes over a wide range of harmonics. Statistical averaging of absolute values of logarithmic ratios of rotational-harmonic amplitudes is used to minimize fluctuations caused by multiple-tooth contact and manufacturing errors on the subject gear. Synchronous averaging is employed to minimize effects of noise and manufacturing errors on the mating gear. Time-windowing tailored to contact ratios of mating gears is utilized to isolate individual tooth locations. Resultant windowing effects on availability of useful rotational harmonics are analyzed. Application of the algorithm to detection of seeded bending-fatigue faults on a planetary ring-gear tooth indicates that successful detections were achieved. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper presents the results of computer simulation of bearing misalignment defects in a power turbogenerator. This malfunction is typical for great multi-rotor and multi-bearing rotating machines and very common in power turbo-sets. Necessary calculations were carried out by the computer code system MESWIR, developed and used at the IFFM in Gdansk for calculating dynamics of rotors supported on oil bearings. The results are presented in the form of a set of journal and bush trajectories of all turbo-set bearings. Our analysis focuses on the vibrational effects of displacing the two most vulnerable machine bearings in horizontal and vertical directions by the maximum acceptable range calculated with regard to bearing vibration criterion. This assumption required preliminary assessment of the maximum values for the permissible bearing dislocations. We show the relations between the attributes of the particular bearing trajectories and the bearing displacements in relation to their base design position. The shape and dimensions of bearing trajectories are interpreted based on the theory of hydrodynamic lubrication of oil bearings. It was shown that the relative journal trajectories and absolute bush trajectories carry much important information about the dynamic state of the machine, indicating also the way in which bearings are loaded. Therefore, trajectories can be a source of information about the position and direction of bearing misalignments. This article indicates the potential of using trajectory patterns for diagnosing misalignment defects in rotating machines and suggests including sets of trajectory patterns to the knowledge base of a machine diagnostic system. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents a simulation model for a gearbox test rig, in which a range of bearing faults can be implemented. Bearing faults sometimes manifest themselves by their interaction with meshing gears, and to simulate this it is necessary to model a whole system of gears and shafts supported in bearings. This has now been done for an experimental test rig through the incorporation of a time-varying, non-linear stiffness bearing model into a previously developed gear model. The incorporated bearing model is based on Hertzian contact theory, which relates the raceway displacement to the bearing load, and also accounts for the slippage between the elements. It has the capacity to model localised spalls (inner race, outer race and rolling elements), which are discussed in this part of the paper and extended inner and outer race faults (rough surfaces), which are discussed in part II. Even though the whole gearbox has not been modelled in detail, the non-linear time-varying gear-meshing operation is modelled in some detail. Both simulated and experimental localised fault signals (acceleration signals) were subjected to the same diagnostic techniques; namely spectrum comparisons, Spectral Kurtosis (SK) analysis and envelope analysis. The processed simulated signals showed a similar pattern to that observed in their measured counterparts and were found to have a characteristic, referred to in the literature as double pulses, corresponding to entry into and exit from the localised fault. The simulation model will be useful for producing typical fault signals from gearboxes to test new diagnostic algorithms, and possibly prognostic algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The advanced technology CR gearbox was designed for high efficiency, low weight, long life, and improved maintainability. The differential planetary CR gearbox features double helical gears, double row cylindrical roller bearings integral with planet gears, tapered roller prop support bearings, and a flexible ring gear and diaphragm to provide load sharing. A new Allison propfan back-to-back gearbox test facility was constructed. Extensive rotating and stationary instrumentation was used to measure temperature, strain, vibration, deflection and efficiency under representative flight operating conditions. The tests verified smooth, efficient gearbox operation. The highly-instrumented advanced CR gearbox was successfully tested to design speed and power (13,000 HP), and to a 115 percent overspeed condition. Measured CR gearbox efficiency was 99.3 percent at the design point based on heat loss to the oil. Tests demonstrated low vibration characteristics of double helical gearing, proper gear tooth load sharing, low stress levels, and the high load capacity of the prop tapered roller bearings. Applied external prop loads did not significantly affect gearbox temperature, vibration, or stress levels. Gearbox hardware was in excellent condition after the tests with no indication of distress.},

abstract = {Bayesian inference involves two main computational challenges. First, in estimating the parameters of some model for the data, the posterior distribution may well be highly multi-modal: a regime in which the convergence to stationarity of traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques becomes incredibly slow. Second, in selecting between a set of competing models the necessary estimation of the Bayesian evidence for each is, by definition, a (possibly high-dimensional) integration over the entire parameter space; again this can be a daunting computational task, although new Monte Carlo (MC) integration algorithms offer solutions of ever increasing efficiency. Nested sampling (NS) is one such contemporary MC strategy targeted at calculation of the Bayesian evidence, but which also enables posterior inference as a by-product, thereby allowing simultaneous parameter estimation and model selection. The widely-used MultiNest algorithm presents a particularly efficient implementation of the NS technique for multi-modal posteriors. In this paper we discuss importance nested sampling (INS), an alternative summation of the MultiNest draws, which can calculate the Bayesian evidence at up to an order of magnitude higher accuracy than `vanilla' NS with no change in the way MultiNest explores the parameter space. This is accomplished by treating as a (pseudo-)importance sample the totality of points collected by MultiNest, including those previously discarded under the constrained likelihood sampling of the NS algorithm. We apply this technique to several challenging test problems and compare the accuracy of Bayesian evidences obtained with INS against those from vanilla NS.},

Guided ultrasonic wave testing of the defects associated with resinanchored rock bolts was investigated. Axisymmetrical and threedimensional finite element models were built, one of a partially encapsulated bolt and the other of a bolt with a simulated local corrosion crack. Experimental bolts were then installed in a testing block and typical responses were compared to finite element models of different defect scenarios. Encouraging results were obtained for the smaller axisymmetrical and three-dimensional finite element models, as well as during the experimental investigation. It is recommended that software with energy-absorbing elements should be utilized to consider higher frequencies and longer bolts. Once the integrity of models such as these has been established, the models could in principle be used to train neural networks for use in commercial equipment to determine the integrity of the installed bolt.},

abstract = {Uncertainty Representation and Management (URM) are an integral part of the prognostic system development. As capabilities of prediction algorithms evolve, research in developing newer and more competent methods for URM is gaining momentum. Beyond initial concepts, more sophisticated prediction distributions are obtained that are not limited to assumptions of Normality and unimodal characteristics. Most prediction algorithms yield non-parametric distributions that are then approximated as known ones for analytical simplicity, especially for performance assessment methods. Although applying the prognostic metrics introduced earlier with their simple definitions has proven useful, a lot of information about the distributions gets thrown away. In this paper, several techniques have been suggested for incorporating information available from Remaining Useful Life (RUL) distributions, while applying the prognostic performance metrics. These approaches offer a convenient and intuitive visualization of algorithm performance with respect to metrics like prediction horizon and ?-? performance, and also quantify the corresponding performance while incorporating the uncertainty information. A variety of options have been shortlisted that could be employed depending on whether the distributions can be approximated to some known form or cannot be parameterized. This paper presents a qualitative analysis on how and when these techniques should be used along with a quantitative comparison on a real application scenario. A particle filter based prognostic framework has been chosen as the candidate algorithm on which to evaluate the performance metrics due to its unique advantages in uncertainty management and flexibility in accommodating non-linear models and non-Gaussian noise. We investigate how performance estimates get affected by choosing different options of integrating the uncertainty estimates. This allows us to identify the advantages and limitations of these techniques an- - d their applicability towards a standardized performance evaluation method.},

abstract = {Wind turbine technology is experiencing rapid growth with respect to size, market share, and technological design. Operational and maintenance cost directly determine whether the system is efficient in terms of energy production in comparison with other types of power plants. Condition monitoring of wind turbines is the major field of studies in recent years aiming to increase lifetime expectancy of components while reducing operation and maintenance cost. Operators and researchers are focusing on improving fault detection techniques in order to render wind turbines more reliable. Gearbox in wind turbines has the greatest share of downtime among all other components affecting directly the cost of operation and maintenance. This paper gathers a review on different methods and techniques for gearbox condition monitoring in wind turbines. Furthermore, various methods and techniques in the literature will be presented in order to get an insight onto the most used methods in wind turbine gearbox condition monitoring. Challenges and future aims are also discussed to determine the focus of condition monitoring systems.},

abstract = {Condition classification of rolling element bearings in rotating machines is important to prevent the breakdown of industrial machinery. A considerable amount of literature has been published on bearing faults classification. These studies aim to determine automatically the current status of a roller element bearing. Of these studies, methods based on compressed sensing (CS) have received some attention recently due to their ability to allow one to sample below the Nyquist sampling rate. This technology has many possible uses in machine condition monitoring and has been investigated as a possible approach for fault detection and classification in the compressed domain, i.e., without reconstructing the original signal. However, previous CS based methods have been found to be too weak for highly compressed data. The present paper explores computationally, for the first time, the effects of sparse autoencoder based over-complete sparse representations on the classification performance of highly compressed measurements of bearing vibration signals. For this study, the CS method was used to produce highly compressed measurements of the original bearing dataset. Then, an effective deep neural network (DNN) with unsupervised feature learning algorithm based on sparse autoencoder is used for learning over-complete sparse representations of these compressed datasets. Finally, the fault classification is achieved using two stages, namely, pre-training classification based on stacked autoencoder and softmax regression layer form the deep net stage (the first stage), and re-training classification based on backpropagation (BP) algorithm forms the fine-tuning stage (the second stage). The experimental results show that the proposed method is able to achieve high levels of accuracy even with extremely compressed measurements compared with the existing techniques.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, British Institute of Non-Destructive Testing. All rights reserved. Condition-based maintenance requires the estimation of the remaining useful life of the system, i.e. prediction of the remaining useful life of each component. While the existing published studies suggest various signal processing methods to isolate and identify gear faults mainly based on synchronous average, these methods, in some cases, are not able to accentuate the effects of the fault and therefore do not provide enough information for assessing the type and severity of the damage as required for prognostics. The current research is aimed at improving signal processing algorithms, which are efficient at separating the effects of local faults in gears. The approach utilizes a dynamic model of the gear system. The dynamic model can simulate the vibration signature of healthy and damaged gears with different types and sizes of faults, and different levels of unbalance, misalignment, eccentricity, teeth irregularities and backlash. The insights obtained from the dynamic model simulations were used to develop and validate the improved signal processing algorithms. The capability to extract more accurate information from the signal contributes to isolating the effects of local faults. This paper presents two algorithms: a modified synchronous average and an adaptive difference. The modified synchronous average is designed to overcome the sensitivity of the regular synchronous average to cumulative phase errors. The adaptive difference is a signal derived from the synchronous average and it is designed to separate effects of local faults in one tooth of the gear from the dominating effects of distributed faults. The algorithms' efficacies were examined and demonstrated on simulated signals generated using the dynamic model.},

Recently [11], we have shown that Time Synchronous Averaging combined with Support Vector Machines can lead to efficient bearing fault diagnosis.

This paper is then concerned with the integration of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in this diagnosis procedure to improve its efficiency in such cases. First, we validate the use of TSA as a signal processing tool that will automatically highlight bearing defect frequencies if they are present in the envelope spectrum. Next, twenty classical features (rms, peak, crest factor{\ldots}) are extracted from the envelope of the TSA-signal. To study the influence of Independent Component Analysis on the generalization performance of SVM- boundaries, the twenty dimensional feature vectors are projected in their independent components space. The generalization performance of SVM-boundaries and the influence of signal transmission path as well as the faulty bearing location are then analyzed using these independent components.},

abstract = {Deep learning has attracted attentions in intelligent fault diagnosis of machinery because it allows a deep network to accomplish the tasks of feature learning and fault classification automatically. Among deep learning models, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are able to learn features from mechanical vibration signals and thus several studies have applied CNNs in intelligent fault diagnosis of machinery. However, these studies suffer from the following weaknesses. (1) The imbalanced distribution of machinery health conditions is not considered. (2) What CNNs have learned is not clear. Therefore, in this paper, a framework called deep normalized convolutional neural network (DNCNN) is proposed for imbalanced fault classification of machinery to overcome the first weakness. Meanwhile, neuron activation maximization (NAM) algorithm is developed to handle the second weakness. To verify the proposed methods, three bearing datasets containing single faults and compound faults are constructed with different imbalanced degrees. The classification accuracies of the three datasets demonstrate that DNCNN is able to deal with the imbalanced classification problem more effectively than the commonly used CNNs. By analyzing the kernels of the convolutional layers of DNCNN via NAM algorithm, we find that these kernels act as filters and they become complex when the layers go deeper. This result may help us understand what DNCNN has learned in intelligent fault diagnosis of machinery.},

Failures of IM may occur due to propagation of a mechanical or electrical fault. Hence, for timely detection of these faults, the vibration as well as current signals was acquired after multiple experiments of varying speeds and external torques from an experimental test rig. Here, total ten different fault conditions that frequently encountered in IM (four mechanical fault, five electrical fault conditions and one no defect condition) have been considered. In the case of stator winding fault, and phase unbalance and single phasing fault, different level of severity were also considered for the prediction. In this study, the identification has been performed of the mechanical and electrical faults, individually and collectively. Fault predictions have been performed using vibration signal alone, current signal alone and vibration-current signal concurrently. The one-versus-one MSVM has been trained at various operating conditions of IM using the radial basis function (RBF) kernel and tested for same conditions, which gives the result in the form of percentage fault prediction. The prediction performance is investigated for the wide range of RBF kernel parameter, i.e. gamma, and selected the best result for one optimal value of gamma for each case. Fault predictions has been performed and investigated for the wide range of operational speeds of the IM as well as external torques on the IM.},

This paper summarizes a physics-based remaining useful life prediction method developed in the DARPA engine system prognosis (ESP) program. This investigation focuses on a typical roller bearing fault (or defect) on the outer raceway. Spall detection is based on the fusion of vibration and online oil debris sensors. Spall size estimation is derived from the amount of bearing debris chips that passed through the Oil Debris Monitor (ODM) sensor. Subscale propagation tests were performed to generate the response surface of the spall propagation rate under various operating speeds and loads. A particle filter based approach was used to track the spall propagation rate and update the prediction according to newly arrived diagnostics information. The bearing spall propagation model output, the distribution of remaining useful life, is calculated based on future operating conditions and the time the spall size crossing the failure threshold. The developed RUL prediction method was validated using full-scale bearing spall tests. The comparison of model prediction and measured ground truth demonstrated that the developed model was able to predict the spall propagation rate accurately, and its prediction accuracy and confidence can be further improved by incorporating more diagnostics updates and/or increasing the confidence in the diagnostic data.},

abstract = {Fault detection and diagnosis in mechanical systems during their time-varying nonstationary operation is one of the most challenging issues. In the last two decades or so researches have noticed that machines work in nonstationary load/speed conditions during their normal operation. Diagnostic features for gearboxes were found to be load dependent. This was experimentally confirmed by a smearing effect in the spectrum. In order to better understand the involved phenomena and to ensure agreement between simulation and experimental results, two models of gearboxes (a fixed-axis two-stage gearbox and a planetary gearbox) operating under varying load conditions are proposed. The models are based on two mechanical systems used in the mining industry, i.e. the belt conveyor and the bucket wheel excavator. An original transmission error function expressing changes in technical condition and load variation is presented. Energy based parameters (the signal RMS value or the arithmetic sum of the amplitudes of spectral gearmesh components) are adopted as the diagnostic features. Simulation results show a strong correlation between load values, changes in condition and the diagnostic features. The findings are key to condition monitoring. Thanks to the use of the models one can better understand the phenomena identified through an analysis of vibration signals captured from real machines. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

abstract = {Conventional rotating machine vibration monitoring techniques are based on the assumption that changes in the measured structural response are caused by deterioration in the condition of the rotating machine. However, due to variations of the rotational speed, the measured signal may be non-stationary and difficult to interpret. For this reason, the order tracking technique is introduced. One of main advantages of order tracking over traditional vibration monitoring lies in its ability to clearly identify non-stationary vibration data and to a large extent exclude the influences of varying rotational speed.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nIn recent years, different order tracking techniques have been developed. Each of these has their own pros and cons in analyzing rotating machinery vibration signals. In this research, three existing order tracking techniques are extensively investigated and combined to further explore their abilities in the context of condition monitoring. Firstly, computed order tracking is examined. This allows non-stationary effects due to the variation of rotational speed to be largely excluded. However, this technique was developed to deal with the entire raw signal and therefore looses the ability to focus on each individual order of interest. $\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nSecondly, Vold-Kalman filter order tracking is considered. It is widely reported that this technique overcomes many of the limitations of other order tracking methods and extracts order signals into the time domain. However because of the adaptive nature of the Vold-Kalman filter, the non-stationary effects due to the rotational speed will remain in the extracted order waveform, which is not ideal for conventional signal processing methods such as Fourier analysis. Yet, the strict mathematical filter (the Vold-Kalman filter is based upon two rigorous mathematical equations, namely the data equation and the structural equation, to realize the filter) gives this technique an excellent ability to focus on the orders of interest. $\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThirdly, the empirical mode decomposition method is studied. In the literature, this technique is claimed to be an effective diagnostic tool for various kinds of applications including diagnosis of rotating machinery faults. Its unique empirical way of extracting non-stationary and non-linear signals allows it to capture machine fault information which is intractable by other order tracking methods. But since there is no precise mathematical definition for an intrinsic mode function in empirical mode decomposition and – as far as could be ascertained – no published assessment of the relationship between an order and an intrinsic mode function, this technique has not been properly considered by analysts in terms of order tracking. As a result, its abilities have not really been explored in the context of order related vibrations in rotating machinery. In this research, the relationship between an order and an intrinsic mode function is discussed and it is treated as a special kind of order tracking method. $\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nIn stead of focusing individually on each order tracking technique, the current work synthesizes different order tracking techniques. Through combination, exchange and reconciliation of ideas between these order tracking techniques, three improved order tracking techniques are developed for the purpose of enhancing order tracking analysis in condition monitoring. The techniques are Vold-Kalman filter and computed order tracking (VKC-OT), intrinsic mode function and Vold-Kalman filter order tracking (IVK-OT) and intrinsic cycle re-sampling (ICR). Indeed, these improved approaches contribute to current order tracking practice, by providing new order tracking methods with new capabilities for condition monitoring of systems which are intractable by traditional order tracking methods, or which enhances results obtained by these traditional methods.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe work commences with a discussion of the inter-relationship between the order tracking methods which are considered in the thesis, and exposition of the scope of the work and an explanation of the way these independent order tracking techniques are integrated in the thesis. $\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nTo demonstrate the abilities of the improved order tracking techniques, two simulation models are established. One is a simple single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) rotor model with which VKC-OT and IVK-OT techniques are demonstrated. The other is a simplified gear mesh model through which the effectiveness of the ICR technique is proved. $\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nFinally two experimental set-ups in the Sasol Laboratory for Structural Mechanics at the University of Pretoria are used for demonstrating the improved approaches for real rotating machine signals. One test rig was established to monitor an automotive alternator driven by a variable speed motor. A stator winding inter-turn short was artificially introduced. Advantages of the VKC-OT technique are presented and features clear and clean order components under non-stationary conditions. The diagnostic ability of the IVK-OT technique of further decomposing an intrinsic mode function is also demonstrated via signals from this test rig, so that order signals and vibrations that modulate orders in IMFs can be separated and used for condition monitoring purposes.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe second experimental test rig is a transmission gearbox. Artificially damaged gear teeth were introduced. The ICR technique provides a practical alternative tool for fault diagnosis. It proves to be effective in diagnosing damaged gear teeth. $\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n{\textcopyright} 2010 University of Pretoria.

abstract = {This paper presents a sequential approach used in fatigue life prediction of a low pressure steam turbine blade during resonance conditions encountered during a turbine start-up by incorporating probabilistic principles. Material fatigue properties are determined through experimental testing of used blade material X22CrMoV12-1 along with statistical modelling using regression analysis to interpret the stress-life diagram. A finite element model of a free-standing LP blade is developed using the principle of sub-structuring which enables the vibration characteristics and transient stress response of the blade to be determined for variations in blade damping. Random curve fitting routines are performed on the fatigue and FEM stress data to ensure that the selection of the random variables used in fatigue life calculations is stochastic in nature. The random vectors are selected from a multivariate normal distribution. The use of confidence intervals in the probabilistic fatigue life model works effectively in being able to account for uncertainty in the material fatigue strength parameters and varying stress in the blade root. The predicted fatigue life of the blade is shown to be in good agreement with discrete life modelling results.},

abstract = {Rolling element bearing is one of the important components in rotary machines. Although a significant quantum of work has been done on bearing defect monitoring, estimation of defect size in bearing elements is still a challenge. In this paper, a technique based on decomposition using Symlet wavelet is proposed for measuring outer race defect width of taper roller bearing. Experiments were carried out on a customized test setup. Seeded defects of different size were introduced separately in the form of an axial groove on the outer race of taper roller bearings using laser engraving technique. It is not only difficult but ambiguous to detect the entry point in the groove defect by making use of the signal. The ambiguity gets reduced by using Symlet5 wavelet due to its linear phase nature which maintains sharpness in the signal even when there is a sudden change in signal. The proposed technique has been successfully implemented for measuring defect width over a range of 0.5776-1.9614 mm. The resulting measure of defect width has been also verified using image analysis. Maximum deviation in result has been found to be 4.06{\%} for the defect width of 1.1820 mm at no load which was found further reduced to 1.02{\%} with increase in load. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed system consisted of a combination of signal feature extraction using discrete wavelet transform technique and fault identification using fuzzy-logic inference. Traditionally, the technique for fault diagnosis in rotating machinery depends on the experience of the technician. However, the rotating machinery may be operated in a complex and noisy environment. The conventional diagnosis technique has difficulty detecting the fault features, such as in a noisy environment. In the present study, a discrete wavelet transform technique using vibration signals in a gear-set experimental platform is studied. The extraction method of feature vector is based on discrete wavelet transform with energy spectrum. Further, the fuzzy-logic inference is proposed to develop the diagnostic rules of the data base in the present fault identification system. The experimental works are performed to evaluate the effect of fault diagnosis in a gear-set platform under various operation conditions.

abstract = {Gearboxes often operate under fluctuating load conditions during service. Conventional techniques for monitoring vibration are based on the assumption that changes in the measured structural response are caused by deterioration in the condition of the gearbox. However, this assumption is not valid for fluctuating load conditions. To find a methodology that could deal with such conditions, experiments were conducted on a gearbox test rig with different levels of tooth damage severity and the capability of applying fluctuating loads to the gear system. Different levels of fluctuation in constant loads as well as in sinusoidal, step and chirp loads were considered. The test data were order tracked and time synchronously averaged with the rotation of the shaft in order to compensate for the variation in rotational speed induced by the fluctuating loads. A pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution was then applied to the test data, in order to identify the influence of the fluctuating load conditions. In this work, a vibration waveform normalisation approach is presented, which enables the use of the pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution to indicate deteriorating fault conditions under fluctuating load conditions. Statistical parameters and various other features were extracted from the distribution in order to indicate the linear separation of the values for various fault conditions, after applying the vibration waveform normalisation approach. Feature vectors were compiled for the various fault and load conditions. Mahalanobis distances were calculated between the various feature vectors and an average feature vector was compiled from data measured on the undamaged gearbox. It was proved that the Mahalanobis distance could be used as a single parameter, which can readily be monotonically trended to indicate the progression of a fault condition under fluctuating load conditions. It was shown that a single layer perceptron network could be trained with the perceptron learning rule within a finite number of iterations.},

@article{Bozchalooi2008,
abstract = {The vibration signal measured from a bearing contains vital information for the prognostic and health assessment purposes. However, when bearings are installed as part of a complex mechanical system, the measured signal is often heavily clouded by various noises due to the compounded effect of interferences of other machine elements and background noises present in the measuring device. As such, reliable condition monitoring would not be possible without proper de-noising. This is particularly true for incipient bearing faults with very weak signature signals. A new de-noising scheme is proposed in this paper to enhance the vibration signals acquired from faulty bearings. This de-noising scheme features a spectral subtraction to trim down the in-band noise prior to wavelet filtering. The Gabor wavelet is used in the wavelet transform and its parameters, i.e., scale and shape factor are selected in separate steps. The proper scale is found based on a novel resonance estimation algorithm. This algorithm makes use of the information derived from the variable shaft rotational speed though such variation is highly undesirable in fault detection since it complicates the process substantially. The shape factor value is then selected by minimizing a smoothness index. This index is defined as the ratio of the geometric mean to the arithmetic mean of the wavelet coefficient moduli. De-noising results are presented for simulated signals and experimental data acquired from both normal and faulty bearings with defective outer race, inner race, and rolling element. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to cope with constraints of the industrial world, the early detection of faults has now become essential. In that context vibration analysis has proven to be an effective tool, on the condition to be well utilized. DYNAE, a French leading company in that field, has developed a new Gear toolbox in its DynamX home software, which is dedicated to the diagnosis of gearbox systems. Based on the knowledge of kinematical data, the toolbox automatically performs a series of processing in order to detect and assess the severity of gear faults. A first tool performs the computation of the averaged gear profiles (without the need of a tachometer measurement) which are useful for the diagnosis of faults inducing modulations of the meshing efforts (geometrical faults, eccentricity?). A second tool allows the detection of impulsive phenomena such as shocks that may be generated by tooth faults at an early stage (wear, pitting), and displays the results on polar representations. The analysis of the motor electrical current may also be useful, especially in low speed applications, as known to be suited to the detection of torsional effects, which may be induced by faults such as cracked teeth. These techniques are illustrated on examples taken from the industry.},

Accurate RUL estimation plays a critical role in Prognostics and Health Management(PHM). Data driven approaches for RUL estimation use sensor data and operational data to estimate RUL. Traditional regression based approaches and recent Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach use features created from sliding windows to build models.

Sequence learning models such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have flaws when modeling sequence information. HMMs are limited to discrete hidden states and are known to have issues when modeling long-term dependencies in the data. RNNs also have issues with long-term dependencies. In this work, we propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach for RUL estimation, which can make full use of the sensor sequence information and expose hidden patterns within sensor data with multiple operating conditions, fault and degradation models. Extensive experiments using three widely adopted Prognostics and Health Management data sets show that LSTM for RUL estimation significantly outperforms traditional approaches for RUL estimation as well as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).{\textless}br/{\textgreater} {\&}copy; 2017 IEEE.},

The corresponding model combines: (i) a permeance network aimed at representing squirrel-cage induction motors and (ii) a 3D dynamic model of spur and helical gears including the shafts and bearings. Some classic motor defects (rotor eccentricity) and gear faults (tooth spalls) are considered and an iterative solution technique is presented which makes it possible to solve the coupled electro-mechanical problem. Based on a number of simulations, it is shown that the frequencies associated with defects can be identified and that distant detection and monitoring of tooth faults using stator currents seem promising alternatives to the classic techniques based on mechanical vibration analysis. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Vibration-induced gear noise and dynamic loads remain key concerns in many transmission applications that use planetary gears. Tooth separations at large vibrations introduce nonlinearity in geared systems. The present work examines the complex, nonlinear dynamic behavior of spur planetary gears using two models: (i) a lumped-parameter model, and (ii) a finite element model. The two-dimensional (2D) lumped-parameter model represents the gears as lumped inertias, the gear meshes as nonlinear springs with tooth contact loss and periodically varying stiffness due to changing tooth contact conditions, and the supports as linear springs. The 2D finite element model is developed from a unique finite element-contact analysis solver specialized for gear dynamics. Mesh stiffness variation excitation, corner contact, and gear tooth contact loss are all intrinsically considered in the finite element analysis. The dynamics of planetary gears show a rich spectrum of nonlinear phenomena. Nonlinear jumps, chaotic motions, and period-doubling bifurcations occur when the mesh frequency or any of its higher harmonics are near a natural frequency of the system. Responses from the dynamic analysis using analytical and finite element models are successfully compared qualitatively and quantitatively. These comparisons validate the effectiveness of the lumped-parameter model to simulate the dynamics of planetary gears. Mesh phasing rules to suppress rotational and translational vibrations in planetary gears are valid even when nonlinearity from tooth contact loss occurs. These mesh phasing rules, however, are not valid in the chaotic and period-doubling regions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Bayes' pool table example. The process we just completed is what Thomas Bayes (1702–1761) did. He illustrated the problem with balls on a table. I'll paraphrase his illustration using the ter-minology we developed above. Suppose a ball W is placed on a pool table so that " there shall be the same probability that it rests upon any equal part of the plane [rectangle] as another. " We'll suppose the length of the table is 1 and that the distance of W from one end, call it the left end, is p. We don't know where W is placed, so our prior distribution on p is uniform, that is, the density function for p is uniform on the interval [0, 1]. Next suppose another ball O is repeatedly ran-domly placed on the table n times, and in k of these placements ball O is closer to the left end than ball W is. Suppose all we know is that of the n times O was placed, k times was placed closer to the left end. Given that outcome what is the posterior distribution for p? We just worked out the answer. The prior distribution for p was uni-form on [0, 1]. Therefore, the posterior distribution is Beta(k + 1, n + 1 − k). The conjugate prior family for Bernouli dis-tributions. There are, of course, applications where the prior distribution on p should be uniform on [0, 1]. But sometimes you have other informa-tion that suggests p isn't uniformly distributed on [0, 1] but has some other distribution. Fortunately, the whole family of beta distributions works well here. That is, if the prior distribution is any beta distribution Beta($\alpha$ 0 , $\beta$ 0), and we observe k suc-cesses and l failures, then the posterior distribution is Beta($\alpha$ 0 +k, $\beta$ 0 +l). Here's why. The prior distri-bution f (p) was proportional to p $\alpha$−1 (1−p) $\beta$−1 , and the posterior distribution f (p|x) is proportional to p k (1 − p) l times the prior, therefore},

abstract = {Rotating machines are widely used in engineering for applications which include power generation and machine propulsion systems. These machines have to be accurately monitored and maintained to avoid system failures. Vibration analysis, which involves the use of contact and non-contact measurement techniques to capture vibrational data indicative of the condition of a machine, is normally used for this purpose. 3D Point Tracking (3DPT) and Digital Image Correlation (DIC) constitute photogrammetric-based optical non-contact measurement techniques that have proven to be efficient for the vibration analysis of rotating machinery. In addition to complex image processing software and tracking algorithms, these two approaches typically require surface preparation in the form of markers and speckle patterns. These requirements limit the applicability of photogrammetry as a condition monitoring tool, especially when it comes to industrial environments. This paper proposes 2D shape analysis for target-less non-contact measurement in condition monitoring of rotating machines. Through comparison to measurements captured using conventional proximity probes on an experimental test setup, it is also illustrated how different dynamic characteristics of a rotating system can be distinguished using this measurement approach.},

abstract = {This paper presents the use of statistically rigorous algorithms combined with active-sensing impedance methods for damage identification in engineering systems. In particular, we propose to use statistical pattern recognition methods to address damage classification and data mining issues associated with the examination of large numbers of impedance signals for health monitoring applications. In this paper, in order to diagnose damage with statistical confidence, the impedance-based monitoring is cast in the context of an outlier detection framework. A modified auto-regressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX) in the frequency domain is developed and the damage-sensitive feature is obtained by quantifying the differences between the measured impedance and the output of the ARX model. Furthermore, because of the non-Gaussian nature of the feature distribution tails, extreme value statistics is employed to develop a robust damage classifier. This paper concludes with a numerical example on a 5 degree-of-freedom system and an experimental investigation on a multi-story building model to demonstrate the performance of the proposed concept. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A nonlinear time series analysis is presented to detect damage in systems under varying operational and environmental conditions. This paper summarizes the use of a state-space reconstruction to infer the geometrical structure of a deterministic dynamical system from observed time series of the system response at multiple locations. The unique contribution of this paper is using a Multivariate Autoregressive (MAR) model of a baseline health condition to predict the state space, where the model encodes the embedding vectors rather than scalar time series. A hypothesis test is established that the MAR model will fail to predict future response if damage is present in the test condition, and this test is investigated for robustness in the context of operational and environmental variability (nondamage-related events). The applicability of this approach is demonstrated using multi-channel acceleration time series from a base-excited three-story building structure tested in laboratory environment. Under the assumption that many "real-word" damage modes induce transitions from linear to nonlinear response in a system, damage is simulated by a bumper mechanism that creates a repetitive, impact-type nonlinearity. Operational and environmental variations are simulated by changing stiffness and mass conditions, based on the assumption that these sources of variability usually manifest themselves as linear effects on measured data. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper reports the performance of an Artificial Neural Network based road condition monitoring methodology on measured data obtained from a Land Rover Defender 110 which was driven over discrete obstacles and Belgian paving. In a previous study it was demonstrated, using data calculated from a numerical model, that the neural network was able to reconstruct road profiles and their associated defects within good levels of fitting accuracy and correlation. A nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs was trained in a series-parallel framework. When compared to the parallel framework, the series-parallel framework offered the advantage of fast training but had a shortcoming in that it required feed-forward of true road profiles. In this study, the true profiles are not available and the test data are obtained from field measurements. Training data are numerically generated by making minor adjustments to the real measured profiles and applying them to a full vehicle model of the Land Rover. This is done to avoid using the same road profile and acceleration data for training and testing or validating the neural network. A static feed-forward neural network is trained and consequently tested on the real measured data. The results show very good correlations over both the discrete obstacles and the Belgian paving. The random nature of the Belgian paving necessitated correlations to be made using their displacement spectral densities as well as evaluations of RMS error percent values of the raw road profiles. The use of displacement spectral densities is considered to be of much more practical value than the road profiles since they can easily be interpreted into road roughness measures by plotting them over an internationally recognized standard roughness scale. {\textcopyright} 2014 ISTVS.

It takes into account the most important phenomena involved in the operation of this kind of machines. Two main sources of noise and vibration can be considered: pressure and gear meshing. Fluid pressure distribution on gears, which is time-varying, is computed and included as a resultant external force and torque acting on the gears. Parametric excitations due to time-varying meshing stiffness, the tooth profile errors (obtained by a metrological analysis), the backlash effects between meshing teeth, the lubricant squeeze and the possibility of tooth contact on both lines of action were also included. Finally, the torsional stiffness and damping of the driving shaft and the non-linear behaviour of the hydrodynamic journal bearings were also taken into account. Model validation was carried out on the basis of experimental data concerning case accelerations and force reactions. The model can be used in order to analyse the pump dynamic behaviour and to identify the effects of modifications in design and operation parameters, in terms of vibration and dynamic forces. Part I is devoted to the calculation of the gear eccentricity in the steady-state condition as a result of the balancing between mean pressure loads, mean meshing force and bearing reactions, while in Part II the meshing phenomena are fully explained and the main simulation results are presented. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

As considering a gearbox condition monitoring mostly it is not taken the influence of varying external load. Recently, the new diagnostic feature has been developed by the authors, which is defined as the gearbox susceptibility/yielding characteristic to operation condition (load, velocity variability). In this case another fault has to be taken into consideration. It has been found the influence of increased bearing backlash to the gearbox susceptibility/yielding characteristic to the operation condition. The increased backlash fault is the result of harsh environment in which gearboxes operate. Mostly, it is influenced by very fine hard dust particles, which get into gearbox oil and cause the abrasive wear of gearbox elements. The paper will give computer simulation results, which show the influence of the increased rolling element bearing backlash to the load yielding characteristic and influence of other distributed faults.

However, an effective analysis is only possible if the vibration features of planetary gearboxes are properly understood.

Two different models are considered: phenomenological model, which is an analytical-mathematical formulation based on observation, and lumped-parameter model, which is based on the solution of the equations of motion of the system. Results of both models are not directly comparable, because the phenomenological model provides the vibration on a fixed radial direction, such as the measurements of the vibration sensor mounted on the outer part of the ring gear. On the other hand, the lumped-parameter model provides the vibrations on the basis of a rotating reference frame fixed to the carrier. To overcome this situation, a function to decompose the lumped-parameter model solutions to a fixed reference frame is presented.

abstract = {A two-stage hybrid model for data classification and rule extraction is proposed. The first stage uses a Fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) classifier with Q-learning (known as QFAM) for incremental learning of data samples, while the second stage uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for rule extraction from QFAM. Given a new data sample, the resulting hybrid model, known as QFAM-GA, is able to provide prediction pertaining to the target class of the data sample as well as to give a fuzzy if-then rule to explain the prediction. To reduce the network complexity, a pruning scheme using Q-values is applied to reduce the number of prototypes generated by QFAM. A 'don't care' technique is employed to minimize the number of input features using the GA. A number of benchmark problems are used to evaluate the effectiveness of QFAM-GA in terms of test accuracy, noise tolerance, model complexity (number of rules and total rule length). The results are comparable, if not better, than many other models reported in the literature. The main significance of this research is a usable and useful intelligent model (i.e., QFAM-GA) for data classification in noisy conditions with the capability of yielding a set of explanatory rules with minimum antecedents. In addition, QFAM-GA is able to maximize accuracy and minimize model complexity simultaneously. The empirical outcome positively demonstrate the potential impact of QFAM-GA in the practical environment, i.e., providing an accurate prediction with a concise justification pertaining to the prediction to the domain users, therefore allowing domain users to adopt QFAM-GA as a useful decision support tool in assisting their decision-making processes.},

abstract = {The ability to achieve accurate bearing prognostics is critical to the optimal maintenance of rotating machinery in the interest of cost and productivity. However, techniques to real time predict the lifetime of a bearing under practical operating conditions have not been well developed. In this paper, a stiffness-based prognostic model for bearing systems based on vibration response analysis and damage mechanics is discussed. As the bearing system is considered as a single-degree-of-freedom vibratory system, its natural frequency and its acceleration amplitude at the natural frequency can be related to the system stiffness. On the other hand, the relationship between failure lifetime, running time and stiffness variation can be established from the damage mechanics. Combining the above two, the natural frequency and the acceleration amplitude of a bearing system can be related to its running time and failure lifetime. Thus, the failure lifetime of a bearing system can be predicted on-line based on vibration measurement. Experiments have been performed on a tapered roller bearing life testing stand under various operation conditions to calibrate and to validate the proposed model. The comparison between model-calculated data and experimental results indicates that this model can be used to effectively predict the failure lifetime and the remaining life of a bearing system. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {A robust feature extraction scheme for the rolling element bearing (REB) fault diagnosis is proposed by combining the envelope extraction and the independent component analysis (ICA). In the present approach, the envelope extraction is not only utilized to obtain the impulsive component corresponding to the faults from the REB, but also to reduce the dimension of vibration sources included in the sensor-picked signals. Consequently, the difficulty for applying the ICA algorithm under the conditions that the sensor number is limited and the source number is unknown can be successfully eliminated. Then, the ICA algorithm is employed to separate the envelopes according to the independence of vibration sources. Finally, the vibration features related to the REB faults can be separated from disturbances and clearly exposed by the envelope spectrum. Simulations and experimental tests are conducted to validate the proposed method.},

@article{Wang2018a,
abstract = {Thanks to the great efforts made by Antoni (Mech. Syst. Signal Pr. 20 (2006) 282–307), spectral kurtosis has been recognized as a milestone to characterize repetitive transients, especially bearing fault signals caused by bearing defects. The basic idea of spectral kurtosis is to use kurtosis to quantify an analytic bearing fault signal constructed from band-pass filtering and Hilbert transform. In our previous study (Mech. Syst. Signal Pr. 104 (2018) 290–293), we mathematically showed that spectral kurtosis can be decomposed into squared envelope and squared L2/L1 norm. Based on this finding, we defined spectral L2/L1 norm and then extended spectral L2/L1 norm to spectral Lp/Lq norm. Moreover, when p = 1 and q = 0, we mathematically showed that spectral L1/L0 norm is the reciprocal of spectral smoothness index. Here, being similar with the functionality of kurtosis, smoothness index introduced by Bozchalooi and Liang (J. Sound Vib., 308 (2007) 246–267) has been recognized as another attractive and important statistical parameter to characterize repetitive transients. Hence, the mathematical connection between spectral kurtosis and the reciprocal of spectral smoothness index was well established. Further, we derived an analytical expression of spectral Lp/Lq norm when complex Gaussian noises were considered as an input to spectral Lp/Lq norm. Consequently, spectral Lp/Lq norm was able to be normalized by the analytical expression. In this paper, we give some further thoughts about spectral kurtosis, spectral L2/L1 norm, the reciprocal of spectral smoothness index and spectral Gini index for characterizing repetitive transients. Firstly, we formulate extraction of repetitive transients as maximization of spectral Lp/Lq norm. Most existing fault detection algorithms derived from spectral kurtosis can be naturally extended to maximize spectral Lp/Lq norm. Secondly, we formally define spectral Gini index and then mathematically clarify its relationship with spectral L2/L1 norm. Moreover, we calculate spectral Gini index for complex Gaussian noises so as to normalize and redefine spectral Gini index. Thirdly, the relationship between spectral kurtosis, spectral L2/L1 norm, spectral Lp/Lq norm, the reciprocal of spectral smoothness index and spectral Gini index for characterizing repetitive transients is revealed. Finally, we mathematically show that each of spectral kurtosis, spectral L2/L1 norm, the reciprocal of spectral smoothness index and spectral Gini index is a monotonically increasing function of the maximum of squared envelope, which indicates that spectral kurtosis, spectral L2/L1 norm, the reciprocal of spectral smoothness index and spectral Gini index are affected by outliers. Based on this finding, experimental comparisons are conducted to show that the reciprocal of spectral smoothness index and spectral Gini index are less sensitive to outliers and they are more preferable to be used in most existing algorithms instead of maximization of spectral kurtosis for extraction of repetitive transients, especially bearing fault signals.},

In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase.

@article{Sawalhi2011,
abstract = {Fatigue in rolling element bearings, resulting in spalling of the races and/or rolling elements, is the most common cause of bearing failure. The useful life of the bearing may extend considerably beyond the appearance of the first spall and a premature removal of the bearing from service can be very expensive, but on the other hand chances cannot be taken with safety of machines or personnel. Previous studies indicated that there might be two parts to the defect vibration signal of a spalled bearing, the first part being originating from the entry of the rolling element into the fault (de-stress) and the second part being due to the departure of the rolling element from the fault (re-stress). This is investigated in this paper using vibration signatures of seeded faults at different speeds. The acceleration signals resulting from the entry of the rolling element into the spall and exit from it were found to be of different natures. The entry into the fault can be described as a step response, with mainly low frequency content, while the impact excites a much broader frequency impulse response. The latter is the most noticeable and prominent event, especially when examining the high pass filtered response or the enveloped signal. In order to enable a clear separation of the two events, and produce an averaged estimate of the size of the fault, two approaches are proposed to enhance the entry event while keeping the impulse response. The first approach (joint treatment) utilizes pre-whitening to balance the low and high frequency energy, then octave band wavelet analysis to allow selection of the best band (or scale) to balance the two pulses with similar frequency content. In the second approach, a separate treatment is applied to the step and the impulse responses, so that they can be equally represented in the signal. Cepstrum analysis can be used to give an average estimate of the spacing between the entry and impact events, but the latter can also be assessed by an arithmetic estimation of the mean and standard deviation of the event separation for a number of realizations, in particular for the second approach. In order to determine the effects of various simulations and signal processing parameters on the estimated delay times, the entry and exit events were simulated as modified step and impulse responses with precisely known starting times. The simulation was also found useful in pointing to artefacts associated with the cepstrum calculation, which affect even the simulated signals, and have thus prompted modifications of the processing of real signals. The results presented for the two approaches give a reasonable approximation of the measured fault widths (double the spacing between the entry and impact events) under different speed conditions, but the method of separate treatment is somewhat better and is thus recommended. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Signal processing using orthogonal cutting force components for tool condition monitoring has established itself in literature. In the application of single axis strain sensors however a linear combination of cutting force components has to be processed in order to monitor tool wear. This situation may arise when a single axis piezoelectric actuator is simultaneously used as an actuator and a sensor, e.g. its vibration control feedback signal exploited for monitoring purposes. The current paper therefore compares processing of a linear combination of cutting force components to the reference case of processing orthogonal components. Reconstruction of the dynamic force acting at the tool tip from signals obtained during measurements using a strain gauge instrumented tool holder in a turning process is described. An application of this dynamic force signal was simulated on a filter-model of that tool holder that would carry a self-sensing actuator. For comparison of the orthogonal and unidirectional force component tool wear monitoring strategies the same time-delay neural network structure has been applied. Wear-sensitive features are determined by wavelet packet analysis to provide information for tool wear estimation. The probability of a difference less than 5 percentage points between the flank wear estimation errors of above mentioned two processing strategies is at least 95 {\%}. This suggests the viability of simultaneous monitoring and control by using a self-sensing actuator. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Fixed transducers often are used to monitor meshing gear pairs in order to detect tooth damage. A simple frequency-domain damage-detection algorithm is suggested for very early detection of such damage. Ratios of rotational-harmonic amplitudes computed from before and after potential damage are utilized to eliminate effects of transducer and structural-path-caused amplitude changes between tooth-meshing location and transducer output, to minimize attenuating effects of multiple-tooth contact, and thereby, to approximately equally weight rotational-harmonic amplitudes over a wide range of harmonics. Statistical averaging of absolute values of logarithmic ratios of rotational-harmonic amplitudes is used to minimize fluctuations caused by multiple-tooth contact and manufacturing errors on the subject gear. Synchronous averaging is employed to minimize effects of noise and manufacturing errors on the mating gear. Time-windowing tailored to contact ratios of mating gears is utilized to isolate individual tooth locations. Resultant windowing effects on availability of useful rotational harmonics are analyzed. Application of the algorithm to detection of seeded bending-fatigue faults on a planetary ring-gear tooth indicates that successful detections were achieved. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {For nearly four decades it has been a practice in commercial and military aircraft application that rolling-element bearings removed at maintenance or overhaul be reworked and returned to service. The work presented extends previously reported bearing life analysis to consider the depth (Z(45)) to maximum shear stress (45) on stressed volume removal and the effect of replacing the rolling elements with a new set. A simple algebraic relationship was established to determine the L(10) life of bearing races subject to bearing rework. Depending on the extent of rework and based upon theoretical analysis, representative life factors (LF) for bearings subject to rework ranged from 0.87 to 0.99 the lives of new bearings. Based on bearing endurance data, 92 percent of the bearing sets that would be subject to rework would result in L(10) lives equaling and/or exceeding that predicted for new bearings with the remaining 8 percent having the potential to achieve the analytically predicted life of new bearings when one of the rings is replaced at rework.. The potential savings from bearing rework varies from 53 to 82 percent that of new bearings depending on the cost, size and complexity of the bearing.},

abstract = {Due to excessive service load, inappropriate operating conditions or simply end of life fatigue, damage can occur in gears. When a fault, either distributed or localised, is incurred by gears, the stiffness and consequently vibration characteristics of the damaged tooth will change. A possible non-destructive technique for damage detection and severity assessment can be derived from vibration analysis. This paper presents the use of vibration analysis in the detection, quantification, and advancement monitoring of damage incurred by spur gear teeth. The stiffness of a single spur gear tooth is analysed theoretically, and due to the difficulties in measuring the gear tooth stiffness, an experimental procedure based on the modal analysis is developed to assess the severity of the gear tooth damage. A pair of spur gears was tested under accelerated wear conditions, and conventional time and frequency domain techniques are applied to the gear vibrations to indicate the presence and progression of the wear. The developed modal stiffness assessment technique is then used to quantify the resulting wear damage to the spur gear teeth. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper, an intelligent diagnosis for fault gear identification and classification based on vibration signal using discrete wavelet transform and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is presented. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) technique plays one of the important roles for signal feature extraction in the proposed system. The abnormal transient signals will show in different decomposition levels and can be used to recognize the various faults by the DWT figure. However, many fault conditions are hard to inspect accurately by the naked eye. In the present study, the feature extraction method based on discrete wavelet transform with energy spectrum is proposed. The different order wavelets are considered to identify fault features accurately. The database is established by feature vectors of energy spectrum which are used as input pattern in the training and identification process. Furthermore, the ANFIS is proposed to identify and classify the fault gear positions and the gear fault conditions in the fault diagnosis system. The proposed ANFIS includes both the fuzzy logic qualitative approximation and the adaptive neural network capability. The experimental results verified that the proposed ANFIS has more possibilities in fault gear identification. The ANFIS achieved an accuracy identification rate which was more satisfactory than traditional vision inspection in the proposed system. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The behaviour of an induction machine during a startup transient can provide useful information for the diagnosis of electromechanical faults. During this process, the machine works under high stresses and the effects of the faults may also be larger than those in steady-state. These facts may help to amplify the magnitude of the indicators of some incipient faults. In addition, fault components with frequencies dependant on the slip evolve in a particular way during that transient, a fact that allows the diagnosis of the corresponding fault and the discrimination between different faults. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is an ideal tool for analysing signals with frequency spectrum variable in time. Some research works have applied with success the DWT to the stator startup current in order to diagnose the presence of broken rotor bars in induction machines. However, few works have used this technique for the study of other common faults, such as eccentricities. In this work, time-frequency analysis of the stator startup current is carried out in order to detect the presence of dynamic eccentricities in an induction motor. For this purpose, the DWT is applied and wavelet signals at different levels are studied. Data are obtained from simulations, using a finite element (FE) model of an induction motor, which allows forcing several kinds of faults in the machine, and also from experimental tests. The results show the validity of the approach for detecting the fault and discriminating with respect to other failures, presenting for certain applications (or working conditions) some advantages over the traditional stationary analysis. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The data obtained from the bearing was processed to detect damage of the bearing using statistical tools and the results were subsequently analyzed to see if bearing damage had been captured. From this study it can be seen that damage is more evident when the bearing is loaded. Also, at the incipient stage of damage the crest factor and kurtosis values are high but as time progresses the crest factors and kurtosis values decrease whereas the peak and RMS values are low at the incipient stage but increase with damage.},

abstract = {This tutorial is intended to guide the reader in the diagnostic analysis of acceleration signals from rolling element bearings, in particular in the presence of strong masking signals from other machine components such as gears. Rather than being a review of all the current literature on bearing diagnostics, its purpose is to explain the background for a very powerful procedure which is successful in the majority of cases. The latter contention is illustrated by the application to a number of very different case histories, from very low speed to very high speed machines. The specific characteristics of rolling element bearing signals are explained in great detail, in particular the fact that they are not periodic, but stochastic, a fact which allows them to be separated from deterministic signals such as from gears. They can be modelled as cyclostationary for some purposes, but are in fact not strictly cyclostationary (at least for localised defects) so the term pseudo-cyclostationary has been coined. An appendix on cyclostationarity is included. A number of techniques are described for the separation, of which the discrete/random separation (DRS) method is usually most efficient. This sometimes requires the effects of small speed fluctuations to be removed in advance, which can be achieved by order tracking, and so this topic is also amplified in an appendix. Signals from localised faults in bearings are impulsive, at least at the source, so techniques are described to identify the frequency bands in which this impulsivity is most marked, using spectral kurtosis. For very high speed bearings, the impulse responses elicited by the sharp impacts in the bearings may have a comparable length to their separation, and the minimum entropy deconvolution technique may be found useful to remove the smearing effects of the (unknown) transmission path. The final diagnosis is based on "envelope analysis" of the optimally filtered signal, but despite the fact that this technique has been used for 40 years in analogue form, the advantages of more recent digital implementations are explained. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.},

Hence, examining the vibration spectrum may deliver information on the type of defects. In this paper a test rig is designed and a pair of brand new commercial ball bearings is installed. The bearings run throughout their lifespan under constant speed and loading conditions. Vibration signatures produced are recorded and statistical measures are calculated during the test. When anomalies are detected in the statistical measures, vibration spectra are obtained and examined to determine where the defect is on the running surfaces. At the end of the test, the ball bearings are disassembled in order to take microscopic photos of the defects. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Local damage detection methods based on the vibration signal analysis are widely discussed in the literature. One of the most popular approach is signal enhancement by filtering focused on extraction of informative content at so called informative frequency band (IFB). In such approach the vibration signal first is decomposed into time-frequency representation and then the measures of impulsivity are applied to the appropriate sub-signals. Till now, kurtosis was preferred as criterion for IFB search. However, for some cases more robust criteria should be used. Jablonski proposed to calculate kurtosis from envelope spectrum, Urbanek suggested MID (Modulation Intensity Distribution), set of alternative selectors as extension of spectral kurtosis (SK) have been defined by Obuchowski. Further extension was recently proposed by Zak, namely statistics related to $\alpha$-stable distribution were used as IFB indicators. This distribution is especially important in modeling data with outliers so it was reasonable to apply this approach in the considered problem. As it was shown, the $\alpha$-stable based methodology for some vibration signals more clearly indicates the IFB in contrast to the classical ones. However, in case of early stage of fault development or developed fault with high level of noise the mentioned criteria (including stability index as a measure of impulsivity) may be insufficient. It is related to the fact that cyclic impulses related to damage are often hidden in the noise (even after time-frequency decomposition). In this paper we propose to apply (instead of kurtosis or stability index) the parameters of tempered stable distribution. This distribution is an extension of the $\alpha$-stable one, however, it possesses many properties of Gaussian systems. It is associated with two parameters which may indicate properly the IFB in case of poor signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper we remind the approach of IFB selection based on the kurtosis and $\alpha$-stable distribution and describe how to localize the information of the fault by using tempered stable approach. The real vibration signal from gearbox is analyzed in the context of presented methodology. Finally, we examine two examples of vibration signals for which the proposed approach is superior with respect to the classical methodology.},

abstract = {In the industrial sector, maintenance plays a very important role in carrying out production by increasing system reliability and availability. Thee maintenance decision is based primarily on diagnostic modules, prognostics and decision support. Diagnostic consists of detection and isolation of faults, while prognostic consists of prediction of the remaining useful life of systems. Moreover, recent industrial systems are naturally hybrid: their dynamic behavior is both continuous and discrete. This paper presents an integrating architecture of diagnostic and prognostic in a hybrid dynamic system. Indeed, the diagnostic system is based on controlling task execution times during system operation. This method is based on a general modeling approach using hybrid automata. The model proposed is detailed by studying a two-tank system. To validate the model, a Stateflow controller is used. These failures are anticipated by a prognostics process based on a prediction of the remaining life for each component by taking maintenance policy into account. Two new methods are compared: ABAO (As Bad As Old) and AGAN (As Good As New), based on the type of repair strategy.},

abstract = {In this paper we extend a sensorless algorithm proposed by Bonnardot et al. for angular resampling of the acceleration signal of a gearbox submitted to limited speed fluctuation. The previous algorithm estimates the shaft angular position by narrow-band demodulation of one harmonic of the mesh frequency. The harmonic was chosen by trial and error. This paper proposes a solution to select automatically the mesh harmonic used for the shaft angular position estimation. To do so it evaluates the local signal-to-noise ratio associated to the mesh harmonic and deduces the associated low-pass filtering effect on the time synchronous average (TSA) of the signal. Results are compared with the TSA obtained when using a tachometer on an industrial gearbox used for wastewater treatment. The proposed methodology requires only the knowledge of an approximate value of the running speed and the number of teeth of the gears. It forms an automated scheme which can prove useful for real-time diagnostic applications based on TSA where speed measurement is not possible or not advisable due to difficult environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are natural generalisations of multivariate Gaussian random variables to infinite (countably or continuous) index sets. GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community. Our focus is on a simple presentation, but references to more detailed sources are provided.},

The goal of this paper is to develop an algorithm (with accompanying complexity guarantees) for fitting a manifold to an unknown probability distribution supported in a separable Hilbert space, only using i.i.d samples from that distribution. More precisely, our setting is the following. Suppose that data are drawn independently at random from a probability distribution {\$}P{\$} supported on the unit ball of a separable Hilbert space {\$}H{\$}. Let {\$}G(d, V, \backslashtau){\$} be the set of submanifolds of the unit ball of {\$}H{\$} whose volume is at most {\$}V{\$} and reach (which is the supremum of all {\$}r{\$} such that any point at a distance less than {\$}r{\$} has a unique nearest point on the manifold) is at least {\$}\backslashtau{\$}. Let {\$}L(M, P){\$} denote mean-squared distance of a random point from the probability distribution {\$}P{\$} to {\$}M{\$}. We obtain an algorithm that tests the manifold hypothesis in the following sense. The algorithm takes i.i.d random samples from {\$}P{\$} as input, and determines which of the following two is true (at least one must be): (a) There exists {\$}M \backslashin G(d, CV, \backslashfrac{\{}\backslashtau{\}}{\{}C{\}}){\$} such that {\$}L(M, P) \backslashleq C \backslashepsilon.{\$} (b) There exists no {\$}M \backslashin G(d, V/C, C\backslashtau){\$} such that {\$}L(M, P) \backslashleq \backslashfrac{\{}\backslashepsilon{\}}{\{}C{\}}.{\$} The answer is correct with probability at least {\$}1-\backslashdelta{\$}.},

abstract = {In data-driven prognostic methods, prediction accuracy of bearing remaining useful life (RUL) mainly depends on the performance of bearing health indicators, which are usually fused from some statistical features extracted from vibration signals. However, many existing bearing health indicators have the following two shortcomings: (1) many statistical features do not have equal contribution to construction of health indicators since the ranges of these statistical features are different; (2) it is difficult to determine a failure threshold since health indicators of different machines are generally different at a failure time. To overcome these drawbacks, a recurrent neural network based health indicator (RNN-HI) for RUL prediction of bearings is proposed in this paper. Firstly, six related-similarity features are proposed to be combined with eight classical time-frequency features so as to form an original feature set. Then, with monotonicity and correlation metrics, the most sensitive features are selected from the original feature set. Finally, these selected features are fed into a recurrent neural network to construct the RNN-HI. The performance of the RNN-HI is verified by two bearing data sets collected from experiments and an industrial field. The results show that the RNN-HI obtains fairly high monotonicity and correlation values and it is beneficial to bearing RUL prediction. In addition, it is experimentally demonstrated that the proposed RNN-HI is able to achieve better performance than a self organization map based method.},

A new strategy based on forecasting of system degradation through a prognostic process is required. The recent advances in model-based design technology have realized significant time savings in product development cycle. These advances facilitate the integration of model-based diagnosis and prognosis of systems, leading to condition-based maintenance and increased availability of systems. With an accurate simulation model of a system, diagnostics and prognostics can be synthesized concurrently with system design. In this paper, we develop an integrated prognostic process based on data collected from model-based simulations under nominal and degraded conditions. Prognostic models are constructed based on different random load conditions (modes). An interacting multiple model (IMM) is used to track the hidden damage. Remaining life prediction is performed by mixing mode-based life predictions via time-averaged mode probabilities. The solution has the potential to be applicable to a variety of systems, ranging from automobiles to aerospace systems.},

The first stage in such a system would be the indication of an extraordinary change in the structure's behaviour. A statistical classification algorithm is presented here which is based on analysis of a structure's response in the time domain. The time-series responses are fitted with Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) models and the ARMA coefficients are fed to the classifier. The classifier is capable of learning in an unsupervised manner and of forming new classes when the structural response exhibits change. The approach is demonstrated with experimental data from the IASC-ASCE benchmark four-storey frame structure, the Z24 bridge and the Malaysia-Singapore Second Link bridge. The classifier is found to be capable of identifying structural change in all cases and of forming distinct classes corresponding to different structural states in most cases. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This study considers the extent to which the coupling of the governing equations influences the fluid dynamics of a large-scale turbo generator journal bearing. The study was conducted by formulating and implementing four fluid models in the OpenFOAM open-source CFD package. The fluid models are constructed so that uncoupled, weakly-coupled and strongly-coupled model formulations can be studied. To reduce the computational costs, a three-dimensional region of the oil film was extracted and considered. This small region was selected because the computational costs would have been extremely high for a full-scale simulation. To this end, the section selected for extraction was the region where the fluid dependencies are known to exert the greatest influence on the fluid behaviour. It was found that for both the weak-coupled and strong-coupled models, the coupling influenced the flow significantly. The extent to which the coupling influenced the fluid behaviour was seen to be dependent on the strength of the coupling, the dependency that introduced the coupling as well as the formulation of the fluid model. The weak-coupling introduced a greater qualitative change where the influence of the coupling was up to half the influence of the pressure dependence. The strong-coupling showed a greater change in the fluid behaviour and the flow departed non-uniformly from the uncoupled models.},

abstract = {The use of sensor networks for monitoring technical systems in real time, and consequently providing information about the condition of a system and providing decision support for maintenance, inspection and repair strategies, is common in various industries and transport systems. In the maritime industries, there has also lately been much interest in condition monitoring systems as a means to ensure the safety of shipping. The layout of the sensor network and the collection and storage of sensor data are important issues to consider in a condition monitoring system. However, one equally important task is the reliable and timely analysis of the available data, the analytics of the system, in order to extract useful information from the sensor signals. The types of analytics that are most relevant for a condition monitoring system are normally referred to as diagnostics and prognostics. Diagnostics typically refers to assessing the current state of the system, whereas prognostics looks ahead and predicts the future development of the system, for example by predicting the remaining useful life of the system. Two key approaches to analytics in a condition monitoring system are model-driven approaches and data-driven approaches. Model-based analytics approaches are based on the physics of the system and a model description from first principles. Data-driven approaches, on the other hand, utilise the information in a knowledge base or available data and are essentially statistical methods. Hybrid approaches denote a combination of model-driven and data-driven approaches. The focus of this paper is on data-driven methods, specifically statistical analytical methods relevant to condition monitoring of ship machinery systems. This paper presents an introduction and high-level review of a number of statistical methods and approaches that are relevant for diagnostics and prognostics of ship machinery systems based on sensor data from a condition monitoring system. In particular, different statistical methods for classification, which is a major task in diagnostics, are presented.},

Key features of the fully subjective approach are discussed, including integration of engineering judgements, uncertainty treatment and type of performance measures to be used. An example related to the problem of identifying "optimal" inspection intervals for an extrusion press is used to illustrate the principles described. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {With increased demand for high speed machinery, the mathematical modelling of the dynamic analysis of gears has gained importance. Numerous mathematical models have been developed for different purposes in the past three decades. In this paper the mathematical models used in gear dynamics are discussed and a general classification of these models is made. First, the basic characteristics of each class of dynamic models along with the objectives and different parameters considered in modeling are discussed. Then, the early history of the research made on gear dynamics is summarized and a comprehensive survey of the studies involved in mathematical modelling of gears for dynamic analysis is made. Generally, a chronological order is followed in each class studied. The goal is not just to refer to several papers published in this field, but also to give brief information about the models and, sometimes, about the approximations and assumptions made. A considerable number of publications were reviewed and 188 of them are included in the survey. {\textcopyright} 1988, Academic Press Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The angular accelerometer is a versatile inertial instrument, with applications ranging from vehicle stabilization to navigation and satellite pointing. A novel angular accelerometer is proposed, which is able to improve on contemporary angular accelerometers and micro-electromechanical system gyroscopes. The sensor consists of micro-machined spiral channels, fabricated on multiple wafers and used to construct a spiral-helix fluid column that generates high pressure during angular acceleration round the sensitive axis. The two ends of the fluid column are joined at a central measurement chamber, where a diaphragm-based pressure transducer produces a signal proportional to the angular acceleration applied. This article presents the dynamics of the sensor, and then investigates its potential. A discrete multiple-degree-of-freedom model simulates pressure generation and propagation, and was verified experimentally. Channel flow is simulated by means of a model derived from Szymanski's theory of unsteady laminar flow. The pressure transducer diaphragmmodel is based on linear flat plate theory. The sensor theory is synthesized in a linear sensor model and the dynamic response optimized by means of the Kuhn-Tucker method. A simulation study demonstrated that a sensor with a resolution of 15 mu rad/s(2) and a bandwidth of 50 Hz can be packaged with a diameter of 22 mm and a height of 22 mm, when referenced against a noise level of 1 mu V/root Hz.},

The vibration response of the structure to the dynamic loading is obtained using a standard finite element package I-DEAS. A force model is proposed to model the localized rolling element bearing defects. Time and frequency domain analyses are performed for diagnostics of rolling element bearing structures. Statistical properties of the vibration signals for healthy and defected structures are compared. The envelope (HFRT) method is employed in the frequency domain analysis. The effect of the rotational speed on the diagnostics of rolling element bearing defects is investigated. An optimum sensor location on the structure is sought. Effect of the structure geometry on the monitoring techniques is studied. An optimum monitoring method can be employed by analyzing the rolling element bearing structure following the procedure proposed in this study.

abstract = {Evaluation of the damage severity in a mechanical system is required for the assessment of its remaining useful life. In rotating machines, bearings are crucial components. Hence, the estimation of the size of spalls in bearings is important for prognostics of the remaining useful life. Recently, this topic has been extensively studied and many of the methods used for the estimation of spall size are based on the analysis of vibrations. A new tool is proposed in the current study for the estimation of the spall width on the outer ring raceway of a rolling element bearing. The understanding and analysis of the dynamics of the rolling element-spall interaction enabled the development of a generic and autonomous algorithm. The algorithm is generic in the sense that it does not require any human interference to make adjustments for each case. All of the algorithm's parameters are defined by analytical expressions describing the dynamics of the system. The required conditions, such as sampling rate, spall width and depth, defining the feasible region of such algorithms, are analyzed in the paper. The algorithm performance was demonstrated with experimental data for different spall widths.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Severe pneumonia is a common disease that intensive care physicians have to face. The review highlights recent findings about microbiology, diagnosis and treatment, including the management of critically ill patients with severe respiratory failure. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological and clinical risk factors strongly influence microbiological cause in patients with severe pneumonia. In addition to typical respiratory pathogens, less common microrganisms and multidrug-resistant (MDR) germs may cause severe lung infections. New molecular diagnostic techniques appear promising for early detection of microbes involved in severe pneumonia. Antimicrobials remain the mainstay of causative severe pneumonia treatment and the optimization of antibiotic therapy may be obtained by applying their pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic properties. Several new strategies have been implemented for the management of acute respiratory failure (ARF) due to severe pneumonia; however, their extensive clinical application is limited by the need for well trained physicians and adequate hospital centers. SUMMARY: Despite advancements in antibiotic and life-supportive treatments, severe pneumonia remains a leading cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. Prompt and appropriate antimicrobial therapy is essential. The use of new nonconventional strategies for ARF management might be effective in more severe patients.},

abstract = {Tunis is a densely populated city. Its building stock was constructed without any seismic design code and mostly over soft soils. These facts make a seismic risk assessment of the city necessary. To prepare a large-scale vulnerability assessment of the buildings of Tunis, the following methodology was employed: (1) a collection of data based on a rapid visual screening procedure was gathered using an inventory form. These data were composed of files and information placed at the disposal of the authors by the municipality of Tunis. The data also contained information gathered by surveys carried out by engineering departments and information gathered from building owners. (2) A classification of building typologies was carried out considering construction material, structural system, age, height, function and state of maintenance. A measure of seismic vulnerability was assigned to each typology considering the first two parameters. (3) A large-scale vulnerability assessment using two methods was conducted for buildings for which few data were available. Vulnerability methods inspired by the EMS98 concepts and the Italian GNDT concepts were modified and applied to pilot-scale buildings located in the downtown zone (Habib Bourguiba Avenue) and in the old zone (Medina). The data analysis, through the application of the two methods, suggests that the vulnerability of buildings surveyed in Tunis is significant and risk mitigation efforts are necessary. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The models are unique in the sense that they are developed for 'heterogeneous1' traffic conditions and tropical meteorology.

Two-year data, from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1998 has been used for model training and data from 1 January to 31 December 1999, for model testing and evaluation purposes.

abstract = {With the tools of modern metrology we can measure almost all variables in the phenomenon field of a working machine, and many of the measured quantities can be symptoms of machine conditions. On this basis, we can form a symptom observation matrix (SOM) intended for condition monitoring and wear trend ( fault) identification. On the other hand, we know that contemporary complex machines may have many modes of failure, called faults. The paper presents a method of the extraction of the information about faults from the symptom observation matrix by means of singular value decomposition (SVD), in the form of generalized fault symptoms. As the readings of the symptoms can be unstable, the moving average of the SOM is applied with success. An attempt to assess the diagnostic contribution of a primary symptom is made, and also an approach to assess the symptom limit value and to connect the SVD methodology with neural nets is considered. Finally, a condition forecasting problem is discussed and an application of grey system theory (GST) to symptom prognosis is presented. These possibilities are illustrated by processing data taken directly from the machine vibration condition monitoring area.},

Vast amounts of data are collected using database management systems from areas of product design, manufacturing, marketing, fault detection and maintenance service of IPS2. An urgent challenge in context of IPS2is how to form reusable knowledge taking advantage of these data records for the sake of guiding subsequent maintenance decision-making. To handle this issue, data mining technology has been used in knowledge acquisition from different databases. However, it needs further investigation how to represent and reuse knowledge mining from these databases in IPS2in relation to maintenance decision-making. Given this observation, this study first presents association rules in the form of Bayesian Networks that are mined from different databases of IPS2and can be used to represent knowledge acquired. It then establishes a knowledge reuse framework based on Bayesian inference, which is used to support related decision-making in maintenance operations. Lastly, the proposed methodology is applied to a real-world case in an agricultural equipment manufacturing enterprise. The experimental results using real-time data sets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in handling maintenance decision-making associated with related fault phenomena.},

abstract = {Derivatives, mostly in the form of gradients and Hessians, are ubiquitous in machine learning. Automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic differentiation or simply "autodiff", is a family of techniques similar to but more general than backpropagation for efficiently and accurately evaluating derivatives of numeric functions expressed as computer programs. AD is a small but established field with applications in areas including computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design optimization. Until very recently, the fields of machine learning and AD have largely been unaware of each other and, in some cases, have independently discovered each other's results. Despite its relevance, general-purpose AD has been missing from the machine learning toolbox, a situation slowly changing with its ongoing adoption under the names "dynamic computational graphs" and "differentiable programming". We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover applications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main implementation techniques. By precisely defining the main differentiation techniques and their interrelationships, we aim to bring clarity to the usage of the terms "autodiff", "automatic differentiation", and "symbolic differentiation" as these are encountered more and more in machine learning settings.},

We derive the analytic form of the induced solution, and analyze the properties. In order to make the proposed framework trainable in practice, we introduce two effective approximation techniques. Empirically, the experiment results closely match our theoretical analysis, verifying the discriminator is able to recover the energy of data distribution.},

To this end, two datasets; one containing 168 PVT samples from different Iranian oil reservoirs and other a databank containing 755 data from various geographical locations, were employed to construct (i.e. train) and evaluate (i.e. test) the models. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NARX and HW models outperform previously employed methods including three types of artificial neural networks models (committee machine, multilayer perceptron and radial basis function), two types of ANFIS models (grid partition and fuzzy c-mean) and several empirical correlations with the smallest prediction error, and that they are reliable models for predicting the oil properties in reservoirs engineering among other soft computing approaches.},

abstract = {There are growing demands for condition-based monitoring of gearboxes, and techniques to improve the reliability, effectiveness and accuracy for fault diagnosis are considered valuable contributions. Feature selection is still an important aspect in machine learning-based diagnosis in order to reach good performance in the diagnosis system. The main aim of this research is to propose a multi-stage feature selection mechanism for selecting the best set of condition parameters on the time, frequency and time-frequency domains, which are extracted from vibration signals for fault diagnosis purposes in gearboxes. The selection is based on genetic algorithms, proposing in each stage a new subset of the best features regarding the classifier performance in a supervised environment. The selected features are augmented at each stage and used as input for a neural network classifier in the next step, while a new subset of feature candidates is treated by the selection process. As a result, the inherent exploration and exploitation of the genetic algorithms for finding the best solutions of the selection problem are locally focused. The Sensors 2015, 15 23904 approach is tested on a dataset from a real test bed with several fault classes under different running conditions of load and velocity. The model performance for diagnosis is over 98{\%}.},

abstract = {Rolling element bearings play a crucial role in the functioning of rotating machinery. Recently, the use of diagnostics and prognostics methodologies assisted by artificial intelligence tools such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines etc. have increased for assessing the health of the rolling element bearings. The effectiveness of these approaches largely depends upon the quality of features extracted from the bearing signals. Keeping this in mind, the authors have presented the various signal processing methods applied to the fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings with the objective of giving an opportunity to the examiners to decide and select the best possible signal analysis method as well as the excellent defect representative features for future application in the prognostic approaches. The review article first quotes some of the condition monitoring tools used for rolling element bearings and then the importance of signal processing methods in diagnosis and prognosis of rolling element bearings. Next, it discusses the various signal processing methods and their diagnostic capabilities by dividing them into three stages: first stage corresponding to the articles published before the year 2001, second stage refers to the articles published during the period 2001-2010 and lastly the third stage pertains to the articles issued during the year 2011 to till date. To focus more on the recent developments in the signal processing methods, the third stage has been partitioned further into several sections depending upon the methodology of signal processing. Their relative advantages and disadvantages have been discussed with regard to the fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings.},

Profile measurements are presented that match lobed ball frequency results with a resolution of 0.025 $\mu$m. Velocity measurement provides a much higher bandwidth for defect detection. Cracks down to 22 $\mu$m in width can be detected with a 150 $\mu$m by 500 $\mu$m wide laser spot size. Cracks smaller than 22 $\mu$m can be detected by decreasing the laser spot size. The method is well suited for a manufacturing environment because of its durability, simplicity, and high speed. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

@article{Abboud2016a,
abstract = {In rotating machine diagnosis, the squared envelope spectrum (SES) is one of the most efficient indicators of the presence of cyclostationarity, which is typical symptom of damages in rolling element bearing. Similarly to other cyclostationary tools, the SES should be applied on the pure random part of the signal otherwise spurious peaks may appear and hide the cyclostationary content. Therefore, conventional deterministic$\backslash$random separation (DRS) techniques are usually used as a pre-processing step to suppress the deterministic (periodic) component. In speed varying regimes, the SES is combined with computed order tracking to obtain an order-domain representation rather than a Hertzian one. Though being order tracked, the deterministic components undergo speed-dependent variations in their magnitude and phase, thus losing their periodicity. This necessarily invalidates the working assumption of conventional DRS techniques and, consequently, jeopardizes the efficiency of the SES. Lately, some sophisticated preprocessing techniques have been proposed to deal with this issue whereof the most important are the improved synchronous average (ISA), the cepstrum prewhitening (CPW) and the generalized synchronous average (GSA). This paper aims to provide a comparative study of these techniques by highlighting their pros and cons. The comparison is performed on real-word signals.},

Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.},

abstract = {The paper shows that for condition monitoring of planetary gearboxes it is important to identify the external varying load condition. In the paper, systematic consideration has been taken of the influence of many factors on the vibration signals generated by a system in which a planetary gearbox is included. These considerations give the basis for vibration signal interpretation, development of the means of condition monitoring, and for the scenario of the degradation of the planetary gearbox. Real measured vibration signals obtained in the industrial environment are processed. The signals are recorded during normal operation of the diagnosed objects, namely planetary gearboxes, which are a part of the driving system used in a bucket wheel excavator, used in lignite mines. It is found that a planetary gearbox in bad condition is more susceptible to load than a gearbox in good condition. The estimated load time traces obtained by a demodulation process of the vibration acceleration signal for a planetary gearbox in good and bad conditions are given. It has been found that the most important factor of the proper planetary gearbox condition is connected with perturbation of arm rotation, where an arm rotation gives rise to a specific vibration signal whose properties are depicted by a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and Wigner-Ville distribution presented as a time-frequency map. The paper gives evidence that there are two dominant low-frequency causes that influence vibration signal modulation, i.e. the varying load, which comes from the nature of the bucket wheel digging process, and the arm/carrier rotation. These two causes determine the condition of the planetary gearboxes considered. Typical local faults such as cracking or breakage of a gear tooth, or local faults in rolling element bearings, have not been found in the cases considered. In real practice, local faults of planetary gearboxes have not occurred, but heavy destruction of planetary gearboxes have been noticed, which are caused by a prolonged run of a planetary gearbox at the condition of the arm run perturbation. It may be stated that the paper gives a new approach to the condition monitoring of planetary gearboxes. It has been shown that only a root cause analysis based on factors having an influence on the vibration solves the problem of planetary gearbox condition monitoring. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The expense and complexity of this approach makes its application impractical for low volume "special" vehicles. In this paper, a fatigue equivalent static load (FESL) methodology for the numerical durability assessment of heavy vehicle structures is presented, where fatigue load requirements are derived from measurements as quasi-static g-loads, the responses to which are considered as stress ranges applied a said number of times during the lifetime of the structure. The application of the method is demonstrated using two case studies, namely a road tanker and a load haul dumper. In both cases, it was possible to obtain adequately accurate fatigue life prediction results, using simplified loading, static finite element analyses and a stress-life approach to fatigue damage calculations, with material properties available in design codes. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Rigamonti2016,
abstract = {Among the various data-driven approaches used for RUL prediction, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have certain prima facie advantages over other approaches because the connections between internal nodes form directed cycles, thus creating internal states which enables the network to encapsulate dynamic temporal behavior and also to properly handle the noise affecting the collected signals. However, the application of traditional RNNs is limited by the difficulty of optimizing their numerous internal parameters and the significant computational effort associated with the training process. In this work, we explore the use of the Echo State Network (ESN), a relatively new type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). One of the main advantages of ESN is the training procedure, which is based on a simple linear regression. Unlike traditional RNNs, ESNs can be trained with fairly little computational effort, while still providing the generalization capability characteristic of RNNs. In this paper, we use Differential Evolution (DE) for the optimization of the ESN architecture for RUL prediction of a turbofan engine working under variable operating conditions. A procedure for pre-processing of the monitored signals and for identification of the onset of acceleration of degradation (i.e., the so-called elbow point in the degradation trend) will be shown. The datasets used to validate the approach have been taken from the NASA Ames Prognostics CoE Data Repository. These datasets were generated using a turbofan engine simulator, based on a detailed physical model that allows input variations of health-related parameters under variable operating conditions and records values from some specific sensor measurements. The results obtained on these data confirm the ESN's capability to provide accurate RUL predictions.},

@article{Aldrich2015,
abstract = {This dissertation covers research carried out over the past 20 years in the area of knowledge engineering in mineral processing, specifically with regard to process data as a form of knowledge. This focus on data-driven plant automation includes the acquisition, interpretation and application of data in the development of decision support systems in mineral processing, as well as the development of data analytical methodologies required to accomplish this. The following subthemes have been covered: o Inferential sensors - predominantly the development of computer vision systems for froth flotation and the analysis of particulate systems, but also acoustic sensors and the interpretation of electrochemical noise. My research into inferential sensors has centred on the development of methodologies and algorithms to interpret image data and not the development of hardware, such as camera systems or other types of sensing devices. A major part of this pioneering research has focused on the interpretation of froth flotation images. Instead of attempting to identify individual objects (bubbles) in these images, we have treated the froth images as statistical patterns. These patterns could be interpreted by suitable feature extraction algorithms and models that could relate these features to meaningful process indicators. The novelty and impact of my research in this area can be inferred not only from the corpus of highly cited papers that associated with the technology, but also from the commercialization of the technology. o Exploratory data analysis - Focusing on unsupervised learning, such as applied in data visualization, cluster analysis and feature extraction. In exploratory data analysis, the main issue is attempting to make sense of many measurements of large sets of variables. Standard multivariate statistical methods have their limitations when dealing with complex data, and a significant part of my research has concentrated on the extension of linear methods to their nonlinear variants by use of neural networks or other machine learning approaches. Work in this area has formed the basis of a sizeable number of industrial workshops and has significantly influenced the development of commercial process systems software. o Data-based process modelling - Machine learning approaches to predictive and diagnostic modelling. The construction of process models plays a key role in process systems engineering. This is the case in advanced control systems, where the ability to predict future process states is critical. Models also play an important role in the interpretation of process data and hence the acquisition of insight into process behaviour and mechanisms. Such models can be developed from first principles, but this is costly and with the abundance of process data, often not necessary. The primary impact of this research has been in the development and application of methods to predict process states or key performance indicators for mineral processing systems. o Process monitoring and fault diagnosis - Multivariate statistical process control from a machine learning perspective. Process monitoring and fault diagnosis has evolved into a key element of process control over the last couple of decades, and is currently experiencing strong growth, with commercial application still lagging significantly behind the advances in academia. My research in this area has centred on the application of neural networks, kernel-based systems, random forests and other machine learning methods to extend current approaches. It has led to the foundation of the Anglo American Platinum Centre for Process Monitoring at Stellenbosch University and the development of algorithms that were adopted by industry on a proprietary basis. o Intelligent decision support and advanced control - Fuzzy decision support systems and neurocontrol based on the use of reinforcement learning. Apart from data that are generated by instruments, tacit knowledge in the form of plant operator experience and theoretical knowledge is also a valuable resource that can be used in the automation of plant operations. This is the domain of knowledge-based or expert systems and research was undertaken in the development and application of these systems in mineral processing. The novelty of this research has mainly been in the proof-of-concept studies published in academic journals and conference proceedings. It goes without saying that in my research, I have been assisted by many colleagues, industrial collaborators, students and assistants. The contributions of these co-workers were often critical to the investigations indicated in this thesis and are indicated as such, hopefully without omission, where appropriate.},

abstract = {An artificial neural networks-based methodology for the identification of road surface condition was applied to two different vehicles in their normal operating environments at two mining sites. An ultra-heavy haul truck used for hauling operations in surface mining and a small utility underground mine vehicle were utilised in the current investigation. Unlike previous studies where numerical models were available and road surfaces were accurately profiled with profilometers, in this study, that was not the case in order to replicate the real mine road management situation. The results show that the methodology performed very well in reconstructing discrete faults such as bumps, depressions or potholes but, owing to the inevitable randomness of the testing conditions, these conditions could not fit the fine undulations present on the arbitrary random rough surface. These are better represented by the spectral displacement densities of the road surfaces. Accordingly, the proposed methodology can be applied to road condition identification in two ways: firstly, by detecting, locating and quantifying any existing discrete road faults/features, and secondly, by identifying the general level of the road's surface roughness. {\textcopyright} 2014 ISTVS.

Motivated by the rapidly transforming landscape for big data analytics and predictive maintenance decision making, we have created a system capable of providing end users with recommendations to improve asset lifecycles. Methodologically, a cost minimization algorithm is used to analyze a large industry service and warranty data sets and two analytical decision models were developed and applied to a case study for an electrical circuit breaker maintenance problem. Some of these techniques can be applied to other industries, such as jet engine maintenance, and can be expanded to others with implications for robust decision analysis. The SMDSS provides a predictive analytical model that can be applied in manufacturing and service based industries. Our findings and results show that existing solution algorithms and optimization models can be applied to large data sets to lay out executable decisions for managers.},

Therefore, it is a great challenge to efficiently learn the representative fault features of the collected vibration signals. In this paper, a novel method called improved convolutional deep belief network (CDBN) with compressed sensing (CS) is developed for feature learning and fault diagnosis of rolling bearing. Firstly, CS is adopted for reducing the vibration data amount to improve analysis efficiency. Secondly, a new CDBN model is constructed with Gaussian visible units to enhance the feature learning ability for the compressed data. Finally, exponential moving average (EMA) technique is employed to improve the generalization performance of the constructed deep model. The developed method is applied to analyze the experimental rolling bearing vibration signals. The results confirm that the developed method is more effective than the traditional methods.},

@article{Zimroz2014,
abstract = {Condition monitoring of bearings used in Wind Turbines (WT) is an important issue. In general, bearings diagnostics is a well recognized field of research; however, it is not the case for machines operating under non-stationary load. In the case of varying load/speed, vibration signal generated by rolling element bearings is affected by operation factors, and makes the diagnosis relatively difficult. These difficulties come from the variation of vibration-based diagnostic features caused mostly by load/speed variation (operation factors), low energy of sought-after features, and low signal-to-noise levels. Analysis of the signal from the main bearing is even more difficult due to a very low rotational speed of the main shaft. In the paper, a novel diagnostic approach is proposed for bearings used in wind turbines. As an input data we use parameters obtained from commercial diagnostic system (peak-to-peak and root mean square (RMS) of vibration acceleration, and generator power that is related to the operating conditions). The received data cover the period of several months. The method presented in the paper was triggered by two case studies, which will be presented here: first when the bearing has been replaced due to its failure and the new one has been installed, second when bearing in good condition has significantly changed its condition. Due to serious variability of the mentioned data, a decision making process on the condition of bearings is difficult. Application of classical statistical pattern recognition techniques for "bad condition" and "good condition" data is not sufficient because the probability distribution/density functions (pdf) of features overlap each other (for example probability distribution/density function of peak-to-peak feature for bad and good conditions). It was found that these data are strongly dependent on operating condition (generator power) variation, and there is a need to remove such dependency by suitable data presentation. To achieve it, load susceptibility characteristics (LSCh) presenting as feature - operating condition space has been used. Presented approach is based on an idea proposed earlier for planetary gearboxes, i.e. to analyse data for bad/good conditions in two dimensional space, feature - load/rotation speed. Here it has been proven experimentally for the first time that there are two types of susceptibility characteristics related to the type of a fault. The novelty of the paper also comes from an extension of previous study that is statistical processing of data (linear regression analysis) in moving window in the long time of a turbine operation is used for feature extraction. It is proposed here to use novel features for long term monitoring. It will be shown that parameters of regression analysis can be used as unvarying, and fault sensitive features for decision making. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In the light of the above it is proposed to undertake a study on the dynamic behaviour of Timoshenko beam supported on hydrodynamic bearings incorporating internal damping using FEM model. Critical speeds are estimated for synchronous whirl at different operating conditions using Campbell diagrams. It is observed in the analysis that in addition to the natural whirl frequencies, for every spin speed another whirling frequency appears in the solution, which is around half the spin speed. In case of fluid film bearings, half whirl is very common phenomenon. In case of dynamic coefficients evaluated using short bearing approximation, it is observed that these additional frequencies are of the same order as that of the synchronous whirling frequencies. The additional frequencies around half the spin speeds are found using only finite bearing dynamic coefficients; this clearly indicates the deficiency in the use of short bearing approximation in similar work. {\textcopyright} 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Comparisons of the adaptive VKF{\_}OT scheme to the original are accomplished through processing two synthetic signals composed of close orders and crossing orders, respectively. Parameters such as the weighting factor and the correlation matrix of process noise, which influence tracking performance, are investigated. The adaptive scheme coping with end effects of computation can simultaneously extract multiple order/spectral components, and effectively decouple close and/or crossing orders associated with multi-axial reference rotating speeds. Furthermore, the adaptive OT scheme is realized through Kalman filtering based upon adapted one-step prediction scheme, where a parameter, the weighting factor, is newly introduced into the computation. Thus the technique can be computed on-line and implemented as a real-time processing application. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {One of the big challenges in machining is replacing the cutting tool at the right time. Carrying on the process with a dull tool may degrade the product quality. However, it may be unnecessary to change the cutting tool if it is still capable of continuing the cutting operation. Both of these cases could increase the production cost. Therefore, an effective tool condition monitoring system may reduce production cost and increase productivity. This paper presents a neural network based sensor fusion model for a tool wear monitoring system in turning operations. A wavelet packet tree approach was used for the analysis of the acquired signals, namely cutting strains in tool holder and motor current, and the extraction of wear-sensitive features. Once a list of possible features had been extracted, the dimension of the input feature space was reduced using principal component analysis. Novel strategies, such as the robustness of the developed ANN models against uncertainty in the input data, and the integration of the monitoring information to an optimization system in order to utilize the progressive tool wear information for selecting the optimum cutting conditions, are proposed and validated in manual turning operations. The approach is simple and flexible enough for online implementation.},

abstract = {This study develops a novel degradation assessment index (DAI) from acoustic emission signals obtained from slow rotating bearings and integrates the same into alternative Bayesian methods for the prediction of remaining useful life (RUL). The DAI is obtained by the integration of polynomial kernel principal component analysis (PKPCA), Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA). The DAI is then used as inputs in several Bayesian regression models, such as the multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF), Bayesian linear regression (BLR), Gaussian mixture regression (GMR), and the Gaussian process regression (GPR) for RUL prediction. The combination of the DAI with the GPR model, otherwise known as the DAI-GPR gave the best prediction with the least error. The findings show that the GPR model is suitable and effective in the prediction of RUL of slow rotating bearings and robust to varying operating conditions. Further, the findings are also robust when the training and tests sets are obtained from dependent and independent samples. Therefore, the GPR model is found useful for monitoring the condition of machines in order to implement effective preventive rather than reactive maintenance, thereby maximizing safety and asset availability.},

abstract = {Many current vibration-based maintenance (VBM) policies for rolling element bearings do not use as much as possible of their useful lives. Evidence and indications to prolong the bearings' mean effective lives by using more accurate diagnosis and prognosis are confirmed when faulty bearing installation, faulty machinery design, harsh environmental condition and when a bearing is replaced as soon as its vibration level exceeds the normal. Analysis of data from roller bearings at two paper mills suggests that longer bearing lives can be safely achieved by increasing the accuracy of the vibration data. This paper relates bearing failure modes to the observed vibration spectra and their development patterns over the bearings' lives. A systematic approach, which describes the objectives and performance of studies in two Swedish paper mills, is presented. Explanations of the mechanisms behind some frequent modes of early failure and ways to avoid them are suggested. It is shown theoretically, and partly confirmed by the analysis of (unfortunately incomplete) data from two paper mills over many years, that accurate prediction of remaining bearing life requires: (a) enough vibration measurements, (b) numerate records of operating conditions, (c) better discrimination between frequencies in the spectrum and (d) correlation of (b) and (c). This is because life prediction depends on precise knowledge of primary, harmonic and side-band frequency amplitudes and their development over time. Further, the available data, which are collected from relevant plant activities, can be utilized to perform cyclic improvements in diagnosis, prognosis, experience and economy.},

abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for monitoring the on-line condition of axial-flow fan blades with the use of neural networks. In developing this methodology, the first stage was to utilise neural networks trained on features extracted from on-line blade vibration signals measured on an experimental test structure. Results from a stationary experimental modal analysis of the structure were used for identifying global blade mode shapes and their corresponding frequencies. These in turn were used to assist in identifying vibration-related features suitable for neural network training. The features were extracted from on-line blade vibration and strain signals which were measured using a number of sensors. The second stage in the development of the methodology entails utilising neural networks trained on numerical Frequency Response Function (FRF) features obtained from a Finite Element Model (FEM) of the test structure. Frequency domain features obtained from on-line experimental measurements were used to normalise the numerical FRF features prior to neural network training. Following training, the networks were tested using experimental frequency domain features. This approach makes it unnecessary to damage the structure in order to train the neural networks. The paper shows that it is possible to classify damage for several fan blades by using neural networks with on-line vibration measurements from sensors not necessarily installed on the damaged blades themselves. The significance of this is that it proves the possibility to perform on-line fan blade damage classification using less than one sensor per blade. Even more significant is the demonstration that an on-line damage detection system for a fan can be developed without having to damage the actual structure. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The interpretation and correlation of this data is often cumbersome, even for the most experienced personnel, and thus automated processing and analysis methods are sometimes sought. As such, statistical features are commonly used to provide a measure of the vibration level that can be compared to a threshold value indicative of a failed cond ition. Many feature vectors have been developed over the years and are well documented in the literature. What is not clear from the literature is the details associated with each feature so that the results are consistent among users. Preprocessing is vaguely stated and terms, such as " residual signal " , are commonly used yet can mean different techniques. An attempt has been made to define the terms, establish the preprocessing needed for each feature, and provide the details needed to produce consistent results.},

Field measurements have shown that the trailing inner wheels that squeal are subject to predominantly longitudinal creepage with little-to-no lateral creepage. The longitudinal creepage acting at the contact of the squealing wheels exceeds 1{\%}, which supports the likelihood of creep saturation and subsequent squealing due to unsteady longitudinal creepage in the large-radius curves. Experimental modal analysis of the wheel types identified to be relevant to squeal has revealed that for each unstable frequency, two eigenmodes are likely to be important: one that has a large mode shape component at the wheel-rail contact in the circumferential direction and another that has a large mode shape component at the wheel-rail contact in the radial direction. A frictional self-excitation mechanism based on mode-coupling is favoured as being responsible for squeal excited in large-radius curves.},

abstract = {In the field of rolling element bearing diagnostics envelope analysis, and in particular the squared envelope spectrum, have gained in the last years a leading role among the different digital signal processing techniques. The original constraint of constant operating speed has been relaxed thanks to the combination of this technique with the computed order tracking, able to resample signals at constant angular increments. In this way, the field of application of squared envelope spectrum has been extended to cases in which small speed fluctuations occur, maintaining the effectiveness and efficiency that characterize this successful technique. However, the constraint on speed has to be removed completely, making envelope analysis suitable also for speed and load transients, to implement an algorithm valid for all the industrial application. In fact, in many applications, the coincidence of high bearing loads, and therefore high diagnostic capability, with acceleration-deceleration phases represents a further incentive in this direction. This paper is aimed at providing and testing a procedure for the application of envelope analysis to speed transients. The effect of load variation on the proposed technique will be also qualitatively addressed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A novel nonlinear model of rotor/bearing/seal system based on the Hamilton principle is proposed for steam turbine systems in power plants. The Musznyska model and unsteady bearing oil-film force model were applied to describe the nonlinear steam excitation force and oil-film force. The Runge-Kutta method was used to solve the motion equation of the rotor/seal/bearing system. The dynamic characteristics of the rotor/bearing/seal system were analyzed with bifurcation diagrams, time-history diagrams, trajectory diagrams, Poincare maps and frequency spectrums. The numerical analysis indicates that the seal force and the oil-film force influence the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of the rotor system. With the increase of rotation speed, the rotor system exhibits rich forms of periodic, double-periodic, multi-periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic motion. The combined impact of steam excitation force and bearing oil-film force may cause a severe vibration which seriously affects the safety and stability of the rotor. The presented model provides a theoretic foundation for further research on the ultra-supercritical steam turbines. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Fractal dimension can quantitatively describe the non-linear behaviour of vibration signal. In the present paper, the capacity dimension, information dimension and correlation dimension are applied to classify various fault types and evaluate various fault conditions of rolling element bearing, and the classification performance of each fractal dimension and their combinations are evaluated by using SVMs. Experiments on 10 fault data sets showed that the classification performance of the single fractal dimension is quite poor on most data sets, and for a given data set, each fractal dimension exhibited different classification ability, this indicates that various fractal dimensions contain various fault information. Experiments on different combinations of the fractal dimensions demonstrated that the combination of all these three fractal dimensions gets the highest score, but the classification performance is still poor on some data sets. In order to improve the classification performance of the SVM further, 11 time-domain statistical features are introduced to train the SVM together with three fractal dimensions, and the classification performance of the SVM is improved significantly. At the same time, experimental results showed that the classification performance of the SVM trained with 11 time-domain statistical features in tandem with three fractal dimensions outperforms that of the SVM trained only with 11 time-domain statistical features or with three fractal dimensions. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Computerization has also opened the doors in areas such as complex statistical analysis through cheap and easy to use software packages. The downside of this is that statistical methods can easily produce the wrong answers. When these tools are applied by people with low statistical literacy 1 then major problems can result, particularly if these methods are incompetently applied to major hazardous facilities. The latter has been observed by the author and that is one of the reasons for this paper. Of major concern is the abuse of Weibull Analysis method. This method has become popular as a tool for the development of maintenance plans. The method is quick, fun to apply and produces quick results. However most analysts ignore the fundamentals listed below:  Data Scarcity -There is always going to be a problem caused by a lack of reliable and representative data in industrial plants.  Mismatched Distributions -There are many component failure distributions that do not match the Weibull distribution yet Weibull method is applied in many circumstances without hesitation.  Multiple Failure Mechanisms -A single Weibull prediction can only have one Beta (shape) value so it does not cope well with components that have two or more failure mechanisms such as a mix of infant mortality, premature failure and wear out.  Irrelevant for Condition Based Maintenance -Weibull analysis does not assist in the development of condition based strategies unless the inspection task has a low effectiveness level 2},

abstract = {The objective of condition based maintenance (CBM) is typically to determine an optimal maintenance policy to minimize the overall maintenance cost based on condition monitoring information. The existing work reported in the literature only focuses on determining the optimal CBM policy for a single unit. In this paper, we investigate CBM of multi-component systems, where economic dependency exists among different components subject to condition monitoring. The fixed preventive replacement cost, such as sending a maintenance team to the site, is incurred once a preventive replacement is performed on one component. As a result, it would be more economical to preventively replace multiple components at the same time. In this work, we propose a multi-component system CBM policy based on proportional hazards model (PHM). The cost evaluation of such a CBM policy becomes much more complex when we extend the PHM based CBM policy from a single unit to a multi-component system. A numerical algorithm is developed in this paper for the exact cost evaluation of the PHM based multi-component CBM policy. Examples using real-world condition monitoring data are provided to demonstrate the proposed methods. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The dynamic behaviour of a gearbox system was previously analysed using a Lumped Parameter Model (LPM), a reduced Finite Element Model (FEM) and a combined LPM and FEM model of the gearbox casing and the results presented in last year's conference. Further investigations on the simulation model indicated the presence of aliasing components in the response spectra. The simulation model has since been updated by using a revised FE model of the casing and addressing the errors detected in the previous model including aliasing. The FE model reduction was based on the Craig- Bampton method of Component Mode Synthesis (CMS) which has the ability to include modal properties of the gearbox casing and internals up to a much higher frequency. The reduced mass and stiffness matrices extracted from the FE model were imported into the dynamic model of the gearbox developed in Matlab/Simulink{\textregistered} which has the capability of simulating time-varying stiffness nonlinearities and geometric faults in the gears and bearings. The results of the updated simulation models are compared with a new set of measurements in the presence of extended inner and outer race faults in the bearings. The paper highlights the application of fault simulation techniques in Machine Condition Monitoring (MCM) and in the training of neural networks by being able to generate a large amount of vibration data without the need to conduct a large number of costly and time consuming experiments.},

abstract = {Various features extracted from raw signals usually contain a large amount of redundant information which may impede the practical applications of machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. Hence, as a solution, dimensionality reduction is vital for machine condition monitoring. This paper presents a new technique for dimensionality reduction called the discriminant diffusion maps analysis (DDMA), which is implemented by integrating a discriminant kernel scheme into the framework of the diffusion maps. The effectiveness and robustness of DDMA are verified in three different experiments, including a pneumatic pressure regulator experiment, a rolling element bearing test, and an artificial noisy nonlinear test system, with empirical comparisons with both the linear and nonlinear methods of dimensionality reduction, such as principle components analysis (PCA), independent components analysis (ICA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), kernel PCA, self-organizing maps (SOM), ISOMAP, diffusion maps (DM), Laplacian eigenmaps (LE), locally linear embedding (LLE) analysis, Hessian-based LLE analysis, and local tangent space alignment analysis (LTSA). Results show that DDMA is capable of effectively representing the high-dimensional data in a lower dimensional space while retaining most useful information. In addition, the low-dimensional features generated by DDMA are much better than those generated by most of other state-of-the-art techniques in different situations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The improvement aids both the reconstruction and interpretation of two crossing orders/spectra such as a transmission-element-regarding order and a structural resonance. The dual function of the Gabor elementary function can affect the precision of tracked orders. In the paper, its influence on the computed Gabor expansion coefficients is investigated. For applying the improved scheme in practical works, the separation and extraction of close-order components of vibration signals measured from a transmission-element test bench is illustrated by using both the GOT and Vold-Kalman filtering OT methods. Additionally, comparisons between these two schemes are summarized from processing results. The other experimental work demonstrates the ranking of noise components from a riding electric scooter.

abstract = {Blades are critical components of turbomachines, failure of a single blade may result in catastrophic failure of the entire machine. One study found that blade failure was the third largest cause of power generation unit unavailability. Their condition during operation is therefore of interest to monitor. Various intrusive and non-intrusive blade vibration measurement (BVM) techniques have been developed for this purpose. Intrusive techniques such as strain gauge approaches and the frequency modulated grid method require expensive and complex alteration of the actual blades and/or casing. Further, they are prone to failure due to operation in harsh working environments. Therefore the use of intrusive techniques has been predominantly limited to design verification, testing and research. Blade tip timing approaches are currently at the forefront of BVM. The practicality, accuracy and ease of implementation of these approaches have limited their commercial roll out. An alternative nonintrusive source of blade vibration information was found in the internal casing pressure signal (CPS). As the machine operates the blade movement excites the fluid in the casing, producing a measureable response. Unlike BTT approaches which deal with a scarcity of information, CPS based methods must identify blade vibration from a complex signal which contains multiple other sources of information. The issue of how to model the blades response and fluid interaction is the topic of this investigation. An available single stage turbomachine mock setup was modified for internal pressure and direct blade vibration measurements. Pressure measurements were taken in line with a redesigned hub and rotor blade assembly. Strain gauges (SG) were applied to blades in order to capture their response. The blades response was modelled as the combination of a forcing function and a multiple degree of freedom transfer function. Repurposed experimental modal analysis frequency response reconstruction techniques were used to model the blades transfer function. It was found that this technique was able to capture the blades underlying behaviour to a high degree. The forcing function was modelled in the time domain as a series of Gaussian shaped force distributions. It was found that the model was able to capture many important aspects of the forcing behaviour. Both the forcing function and blade transfer function were explored using constrained optimisation techniques. The blade-fluid interaction was modelled as a Fourier series. It was shown that the blade behaviour cannot be extracted from a pressure signal using standard frequency analysis techniques. The viability of an inverse problem solution methodology, for the purpose of blade behaviour extraction, was investigated. This was achieved by solving reduced components of the model with SG measurements and observations from pressure measurements. Further the need to isolate the pressure field about individual blades was motivated and a novel time domain windowing technique provided.},

abstract = {Due to excessive service load, inappropriate operating conditions or simply end of life fatigue, damage can occur in gears. When a fault, either distributed or localised, is incurred by gears, the stiffness and consequently vibration characteristics of the damaged tooth will change. A possible non-destructive technique for damage detection and severity assessment can be derived from vibration analysis. This paper presents the use of vibration analysis in the detection, quantification, and advancement monitoring of damage incurred by spur gear teeth. The stiffness of a single spur gear tooth is analysed theoretically, and due to the difficulties in measuring the gear tooth stiffness, an experimental procedure based on the modal analysis is developed to assess the severity of the gear tooth damage. A pair of spur gears was tested under accelerated wear conditions, and conventional time and frequency domain techniques are applied to the gear vibrations to indicate the presence and progression of the wear. The developed modal stiffness assessment technique is then used to quantify the resulting wear damage to the spur gear teeth. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To evaluate the performance of this new method, this paper investigates the effect of two parameters pertinent to EEMD: the amplitude of added white noise and the number of ensemble trials. A test signal with mode mixing that mimics realistic bearing vibration signals measured on a bearing test bed was developed to enable quantitative evaluation of the EEMD and provide guidance on how to choose the two parameters appropriately for bearing signal decomposition. Subsequently, a modified EEMD (MEEMD) method is proposed to reduce the computational cost of the original EEMD method as well as improving its performance. Numerical evaluation and systematic study using vibration data measured on an experimental bearing test bed verified the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed MEEMD method for bearing defect diagnosis. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper investigates gear diagnostics using laboratory measurements on a specially designed planetary gearbox test rig. Planetary gearboxes present a unique challenge to the condition monitoring community. They are complex units, comprising many rotating components, and any vibration signal arising from a faulty gear or bearing, as measured on the outer casing, is likely to contain a substantial amount of extraneous information. While a number of signal processing techniques have been developed in attempts to overcome these difficulties, in this paper we investigate the potential of using an internally-mounted accelerometer to give improved diagnostic performance in the case of seeded planet gear faults. The vibration is also measured on the outside of the gearbox casing, and the diagnostic potential of the two measurements is compared. It is found that in most cases the internal measurements actually give inferior diagnostic performance, although some problems with the internal signals preclude a complete comparison. Along with the measurement points, two diagnostic procedures are compared, both based on the kurtosis of the residual signal obtained after removing regular gear meshing components. The first is based on the well-known FM4 parameter, which uses time synchronous averaging to establish the regular meshing pattern. The second focuses on kurtosis enhancement using autoregressive linear prediction filtering followed by spectral kurtosis. The latter method was found to greatly increase detection capability, with very high kurtosis values obtained in most fault cases.},

The indicator can be interpreted as the virtual age of the system, and can therefore be used to define age-reduction factors of different types of repair in a virtual age or age-reduction process. The state indicator is used as the time scale in a proportional intensity model. In this way, the joint impact of different repair strategies and covariates on the system failure intensity can be evaluated. This relationship is then used to address the question of which subsystems to replace whenever a system comes in for repair and when to set the preventive inspection/repair interval, in order to minimize the expected costs per unit time until the next inspection and/or repair.

abstract = {Despite the widespread practical success of deep learning methods, our theoretical understanding of the dynamics of learning in deep neural networks remains quite sparse. We attempt to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of deep learning by systematically analyzing learning dynamics for the restricted case of deep linear neural networks. Despite the linearity of their input-output map, such networks have nonlinear gradient descent dynamics on weights that change with the addition of each new hidden layer. We show that deep linear networks exhibit nonlinear learning phenomena similar to those seen in simulations of nonlinear networks, including long plateaus followed by rapid transitions to lower error solutions, and faster convergence from greedy unsupervised pretraining initial conditions than from random initial conditions. We provide an analytical description of these phenomena by finding new exact solutions to the nonlinear dynamics of deep learning. Our theoretical analysis also reveals the surprising finding that as the depth of a network approaches infinity, learning speed can nevertheless remain finite: for a special class of initial conditions on the weights, very deep networks incur only a finite, depth independent, delay in learning speed relative to shallow networks. We show that, under certain conditions on the training data, unsupervised pretraining can find this special class of initial conditions, while scaled random Gaussian initializations cannot. We further exhibit a new class of random orthogonal initial conditions on weights that, like unsupervised pre-training, enjoys depth independent learning times. We further show that these initial conditions also lead to faithful propagation of gradients even in deep nonlinear networks, as long as they operate in a special regime known as the edge of chaos.},

abstract = {Pump shafts used for power generation are susceptible to fatigue cracking while often in near-continuous operation. Technology based on torsional vibration is under development for condition-based assessment of shaft health. The focus of this paper is on the relationship between a crack, which propagated due to bending loads, and the torsional stiffness of the shaft. An analytical method to determine the compliance associated with a crack has been implemented for a semi-elliptical surface crack. A 3-D finite element model of a shaft section with a crack has also been used to predict the effect of a crack on stiffness. Fatigue cracks were seeded in shafts on a three-point bend apparatus. A benchtop test rig was constructed to evaluate the torsional natural frequencies of a cracked shaft system. Quasistatic torsional stiffness tests indicated that crack closure has an effect on the results. A torsional finite element model of the benchtop test rig indicates that the first torsional natural frequency is reduced by the propagation of a crack. The reduction in torsional stiffness of the shaft inferred from the natural frequency results is in reasonable agreement with the quasistatic results and the model predictions.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new kind of sensitivity indices based on the principal component analysis (PCA) is proposed to measure the effects of input variables on multivariate outputs. Through PCA, the outputs are projected onto a new coordinate system (eigen space), which is constructed by the eigenvector (principal components). The existent sensitivity indices based on PCA focus on the variance of principal components, which can be considered as a magnitude of the uncertainty in the corresponding coordinate axes. In addition, the direction of the coordinate axes in the eigen space also contains another part of uncertainty of outputs (the direction of the uncertainty). The new sensitivity indices measure the effect of input variables on the direction of the coordinates axes through the angles between the unconditional and conditional eigenvectors. Thus, the new sensitivity indices can reflect different effect of input variables on the output compared to the existent sensitivity indices. The results of three numerical examples and an environmental model show the difference between the new sensitivity indices and the existent sensitivity indices. Since the new sensitivity indices measure the effects of input variables on the multivariate outputs from a different perspective compared to the existent sensitivity indices, they should be mutually complementary to each other.},

Firstly, the integrity of shell elements for accurately capturing the stiffness properties and stress distribution in the vicinity of welds is investigated. Furthermore, the stress response of the structure to random dynamic loading is investigated and validated in terms of its suitability for assessment by the FESL methodology. Nominal stress and hot-spot stress fatigue life predictions are made, based on measurements as well as the FESL procedure. The viability and integrity of the FESL methodology is critically assessed after which the actual fatigue life of the structure under particular loading conditions is determined for comparison. 2007 The Authors.

abstract = {In gearboxes, load fluctuations on the gearbox and gear defects are two major sources of vibration. Further, at times, measurement of vibration in the gearbox is not easy because of the inaccessibility in mounting the vibration transducers. An efficient and new but non-intrusive method to detect the fluctuation in gear load may be the motor current signature analysis (MCSA). In this paper, a multi-stage transmission gearbox (with and without defects) has been studied in order to replace the conventional vibration monitoring by MCSA. It has been observed through FFT analysis that low frequencies of the vibration signatures have sidebands across line frequency of the motor current whereas high frequencies of vibration signature are difficult to be detected. Hence, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is suggested to decompose the current signal, and FFT analysis is carried out with the decomposed current signal to trace the sidebands of the high frequencies of vibration. The advantage of DWT technique to study the transients in MCSA has also been cited. The inability of CWT in detecting either defects or load fluctuation has been shown. The results indicate that MCSA along with DWT can be a good replacement for conventional vibration monitoring. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Bearing failures in rotating machinery can cause machine breakdown and economical loss, if no effective actions are taken on time. Therefore, it is of prime importance to detect accurately the presence of faults, especially at their early stage, to prevent sequent damage and reduce costly downtime. The machinery fault diagnosis follows a roadmap of data acquisition, feature extraction and diagnostic decision making, in which mechanical vibration fault feature extraction is the foundation and the key to obtain an accurate diagnostic result. A challenge in this area is the selection of the most sensitive features for various types of fault, especially when the characteristics of failures are difficult to be extracted. Thus, a plethora of complex data-driven fault diagnosis methods are fed by prominent features, which are extracted and reduced through traditional or modern algorithms. Since most of the available datasets are captured during normal operating conditions, the last decade a number of novelty detection methods, able to work when only normal data are available, have been developed. In this study, a hybrid method combining univariate control charts and a feature extraction scheme is introduced focusing towards an abnormal change detection and classification, under the assumption that measurements under normal operating conditions of the machinery are available. The feature extraction method integrates the morphological operators and the Morlet wavelets. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is validated on two different experimental cases with bearing faults, demonstrating that the proposed approach can improve the fault detection and classification performance of conventional control charts.},

We first block the data by month in order to remove seasonal components and propose a MS-AR model with non-homogeneous autoregressive models todescribe daily components. Then we discuss extensions where the hidden Markov chain is also non-stationary to handle seasonal and interannual fluctuations. The different models are fitted using the EM algorithm to a long time series of wind speed measurement on the Island of Ouessant (France). It is shown that the fitted models are interpretable and provide a good description of important properties of the data such as the marginal distributions, the second-order structure or the length of the stormy and calm periods. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The present paper makes an attempt at early fault detection in a gearbox. In order to evaluate its technical condition, artificial neural networks were used. Early fault detection based on support vector machines is a relatively new and rarely employed method for evaluating condition of machines, particularly gearboxes. The available literature offers very promising results of using this method. In order to compare the obtained results, a multilayer perceptron network was created. Such standard neural network ensures high effectiveness. The vibration signal obtained from a sensor is seldom a material for direct analysis. First, it needs to be processed to bring out the informative part of the signal. To this end, a wavelet transform was used. The presented results concern both a "raw" vibration signal and processed one, investigated for two neural networks. The wavelet transform has proved to improve significantly the accuracy of condition evaluation and the results obtained by the two networks are consistent with one another.},

However, it cannot reveal the signal characteristic information accurately because of the problem of mode mixing. To alleviate the mode mixing problem occurring in EMD, ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is presented. With EEMD, the components with truly physical meaning can be extracted from the signal. Utilizing the advantage of EEMD, this paper proposes a new EEMD-based method for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. First, a simulation signal is used to test the performance of the method based on EEMD. Then, the proposed method is applied to rub-impact fault diagnosis of a power generator and early rub-impact fault diagnosis of a heavy oil catalytic cracking machine set. Finally, by comparing its application results with those of the EMD method, the superiority of the proposed method based on EEMD is demonstrated in extracting fault characteristic information of rotating machinery. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Vibration analysis is a well-established technique for condition monitoring of rotating machines as the vibration patterns differ depending on the fault or machine condition. Currently, mainly manually-engineered features, such as the ball pass frequencies of the raceway, RMS, kurtosis an crest, are used for automatic fault detection. Unfortunately, engineering and interpreting such features requires a significant level of human expertise. To enable non-experts in vibration analysis to perform condition monitoring, the overhead of feature engineering for specific faults needs to be reduced as much as possible. Therefore, in this article we propose a feature learning model for condition monitoring based on convolutional neural networks. The goal of this approach is to autonomously learn useful features for bearing fault detection from the data itself. Several types of bearing faults such as outer-raceway faults and lubrication degradation are considered, but also healthy bearings and rotor imbalance are included. For each condition, several bearings are tested to ensure generalization of the fault-detection system. Furthermore, the feature-learning based approach is compared to a feature-engineering based approach using the same data to objectively quantify their performance. The results indicate that the feature-learning system, based on convolutional neural networks, significantly outperforms the classical feature-engineering based approach which uses manually engineered features and a random forest classifier. The former achieves an accuracy of 93.61 percent and the latter an accuracy of 87.25 percent.},

abstract = {The transmission path from the excitation to the measured vibration on the surface of a mechanical system introduces a distortion both in amplitude and in phase. Moreover, in variable speed conditions, the amplification/attenuation and the phase shift, due to the transfer function of the mechanical system, varies in time. This phenomenon reduces the effectiveness of the traditionally tachometer based order tracking, compromising the results of a discrete-random separation performed by a synchronous averaging. In this paper, for the first time, the extent of the distortion is identified both in the time domain and in the order spectrum of the signal, highlighting the consequences for the diagnostics of rotating machinery. A particular focus is given to gears, providing some indications on how to take advantage of the quantification of the disturbance to better tune the techniques developed for the compensation of the distortion. The full theoretical analysis is presented and the results are applied to an experimental case. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Conventional methods (i.e. time, frequency and cepstrum) can routinely be used to reveal fault-indicating information in the vibration signal. In recent years, Wavelet analysis, which can lead to the clear identification of the nature of faults, are widely used to describe machine condition. Capability of this method in the detection of any abnormality can be further improved when its low-order frequency moments are considered. This paper presents the use of vibration-based techniques in the early detection and advancement monitoring of distributed pitting fault. The pits were seeded on all of the gear tooth surfaces in differing degrees of severity, and intended to replicate the pitting damage due to misalignment. With each fault severity, the helical gears were tested and the resulting vibration data were recorded. The application of employed vibration-based methods (i.e. time, frequency, cepstrum, and wavelet transform: scalogram and its mean frequency variation) to each set of experimental data are presented. It has been found that presence of pitting fault cannot be clearly revealed by the conventional unless fault severity is significantly large. In contrast, the scalogram and especially its mean frequency variation provide early indications of presence and progression of pitting faults in gears even when the fault severity is considerably smaller. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},

abstract = {Bearing failure is one of the major causes of breakdown in rotating machinery. In complex machines, at the incipient stages of bearing damage, the failure signs are weak compared to other sources of excitations (e.g. gears, shafts, rotors, etc.). The task of emphasizing the failure signs is complicated by the fact that changes in operating conditions influence vibrations sources and change the frequency and amplitude characteristics of the signal, making it non-stationary. As a result, a joint time-frequency representation is required. Previous vibration based diagnostic techniques focused on either the time domain or the frequency domain. The proposed method suggests a different solution that applies image processing techniques to spectrograms of the vibration signals in the orders-RPM domain. In the first stage, spectrograms of healthy machines are used to create a baseline. The spectrograms can be obtained using various time-frequency representations (Wigner- Ville, wavelets, STFT, etc). In the next stage, the distance spectrogram between the inspected recording and the baseline is computed. In the third stage, the distance spectrogram is analyzed using ridge tracking and other image processing algorithms. In the fourth stage, the relations between the detected ridges are compared to the characteristic patterns of the bearing failure modes and the matching ridges are selected. The different stages of analysis: baselines, distance spectrogram, ridges detection and selection, are illustrated with real data of damaged bearings.},

abstract = {Machinery prognostics is one of the major tasks in condition based maintenance (CBM), which aims to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of machinery based on condition information. A machinery prognostic program generally consists of four technical processes, i.e., data acquisition, health indicator (HI) construction, health stage (HS) division, and RUL prediction. Over recent years, a significant amount of research work has been undertaken in each of the four processes. And much literature has made an excellent overview on the last process, i.e., RUL prediction. However, there has not been a systematic review that covers the four technical processes comprehensively. To fill this gap, this paper provides a review on machinery prognostics following its whole program, i.e., from data acquisition to RUL prediction. First, in data acquisition, several prognostic datasets widely used in academic literature are introduced systematically. Then, commonly used HI construction approaches and metrics are discussed. After that, the HS division process is summarized by introducing its major tasks and existing approaches. Afterwards, the advancements of RUL prediction are reviewed including the popular approaches and metrics. Finally, the paper provides discussions on current situation, upcoming challenges as well as possible future trends for researchers in this field.},

abstract = {Water supply systems in the United States connect raw water sources to hundreds of millions of water consumers through humongous infrastructure that include approximately one million miles of buried water mains and service connections and thousands of treatment facilities and appurtenances. This enormous set-up is currently operated by more than 170,000 public water systems. Sustainability of the water supply system faces several imminent challenges such as: 1) increasing water main breaks, 2) decreasing fresh water resources, 3) untraceable non-revenue water use, and 4) increasing water demands. However, current water supply management practices are not capable of providing fundamental solutions to the issues identified above. Big Data is a new technical concept to collect massive amounts of relevant data from sensors installed to monitor structural condition, usage, and system performance. This Big Data concept can be realized by deploying Internet of Things (IoT) technology throughout the water supply infrastructure and consumers' usage. This paper presents a schematic development of IoT application for Big Data collection through a myriad of water clients. The scheme consists of downstream and upstream data collection using Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies connecting to IoT. Downstream data shall provide water usage and performance data to clients and upstream data is similar to traditional SCADA and Automated Meter Reading (AMR) systems. Ultimately, all data will be converged to build a Big Data collection system where data mining identifies 1) local and system performances including pressure and flow, 2) non-revenue and illegitimate water consumption, and 3) locations and quantity of water breaks and water losses. The goal of this development is to enable both utilities and consumers to proactively manage their water usage and achieve higher levels of sustainability in water supply.},

In this paper we critically analyze this method and its properties, and show how it can be viewed as a type of approximate 2nd-order optimization method, where the Fisher information matrix can be viewed as an approximation of the Hessian. This perspective turns out to have significant implications for how to design a practical and robust version of the method. Additionally, we make the following contributions to the understanding of natural gradient and 2nd-order methods: a thorough analysis of the convergence speed of stochastic natural gradient descent (and more general stochastic 2nd-order methods) as applied to convex quadratics, a critical examination of the oft-used "empirical" approximation of the Fisher matrix, and an analysis of the (approximate) parameterization invariance property possessed by natural gradient methods, which we show still holds for certain choices of the curvature matrix other than the Fisher, but notably not the Hessian.},

The proposed neural network design, based on a three-layers architecture, helps to reduce the number of parameters of the model after the training phase without any significant loss of estimation accuracy. Nevertheless, the proposed architecture remains sufficiently general to provide a wide range of models among the most encountered in the literature. This reduction, achieved by a convenient choice of the activation functions and the initial conditions of the synaptic weights, is developed in two steps. The first step is to train the proposed architecture under two reasonable assumptions. Then the recurrent three-layers neural network is transformed into a representation of two-layer with less number of neurons, that is, a significant reduced number of parameters. The constructed architecture provided models with reasonable reduced number of parameters with a convenient estimation accuracy. To validate the proposed approach, we identify the Wiener-Hammerstein benchmark nonlinear system proposed in SYSID2009 [1]. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Applied to gearbox signals, these tacho-less methods appear intuitively simple, offer user-friendly graphic interfaces to visualize a pattern and allow the retrieval and removal of the selected cyclostationarity components in order to process higher-order spectra. Two of these tools can deal with time-varying operating conditions since they use an adaptive resampled signal driven by the vibration signal itself for order tracking. Three coherency indicators are proposed, one for every sample of the time pattern, one for each impact (tooth shock) observed in the gear mesh pattern, and one for the whole pattern. These indicators are used to detect a cyclostationarity and analyze the pattern repeatability. A gear mesh graph is also proposed to illustrate the cyclostationarity in 3D.},

abstract = {Bearings are among the most frequently used components. Bearing failure could lead to complete stall of a mechanical system, unpredicted productivity loss for production facilities or catastrophic consequence for mission-critical equipment. As such, bearing fault detection and diagnosis is an imperative part of most of preventive maintenance procedures. This paper presents a parameter independent yet simple to implement fault detection technique. The Teager energy operator is tailored to extract both the amplitude and frequency modulations of the vibration signals measured from mechanical systems. The incorporation of the frequency modulation information into the proposed bearing fault detection method has eliminated the need for interference removal steps. As the amplitude demodulation (AD) is also inherent in the energy operator, the fault frequency can be detected from the spectrum of the energy-transformed signal. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated using both simulated and experimental data. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A variety of approaches that have been developed for the identification and localisation of cracks in a rotor system, which exploit natural frequencies, require a finite element model to obtain the natural frequencies of the intact rotor as baseline data. In fact, such approaches can give erroneous results about the location and depth of a crack if an inaccurate finite element model is used to represent an uncracked model. A new approach for the identification and localisation of cracks in rotor systems, which does not require the use of the natural frequencies of an intact rotor as a baseline data, is presented in this paper. The approach, named orthogonal natural frequencies (ONFs), is based only on the natural frequencies of the non-rotating cracked rotor in the two lateral bending vibration x-z and y-z planes. The approach uses the cracked natural frequencies in the horizontal x-z plane as the reference data instead of the intact natural frequencies. Also, a roving disc is traversed along the rotor in order to enhance the dynamics of the rotor at the cracked locations. At each spatial location of the roving disc, the two ONFs of the rotor-disc system are determined from which the corresponding ONF ratio is computed. The ONF ratios are normalised by the maximum ONF ratio to obtain normalised orthogonal natural frequency curves (NONFCs). The non-rotating cracked rotor is simulated by the finite element method using the Bernoulli-Euler beam theory. The unique characteristics of the proposed approach are the sharp, notched peaks at the crack locations but rounded peaks at non-cracked locations. These features facilitate the unambiguous identification and locations of cracks in rotors. The effects of crack depth, crack location, and mass of a roving disc are investigated. The results show that the proposed method has a great potential in the identification and localisation of cracks in a non-rotating cracked rotor.},

The method of introducing the frictional force between teeth into the dynamic equations is given. The comparison between the results with friction and without friction was investigated using Matlab and Simulink models developed from the differential equations.

The evidence (alternatively the marginal likelihood, marginal density of the data, or the prior predictive) is immediately obtained by summation. It is the prime result of the computation, and is accompanied by an estimate of numerical uncertainty. Samples from the posterior distribution are an optional by-product, obtainable for any temperature. The method relies on sampling within a hard constraint on likelihood value, as opposed to the softened likelihood of annealing methods. Progress depends only on the shape of the ?nested? contours of likelihood, and not on the likelihood values. This invariance (over monotonic relabeling) allows the method to deal with a class of phase-change problems which effectively defeat thermal annealing.},

abstract = {In the presented paper a calculation procedure for determination of dynamic load capacity of large three-row roller slewing bearings is presented. The calculation procedure consists of three main parts: (i) determination of internal contact force distribution in a large three-row roller slewing bearing with consideration of bearing clearances and ring support deformations, (ii) determination of stress field in the contact area between raceway and rollers as a consequence of contact forces and (iii) determination of the bearing's fatigue life due to contact fatigue of the raceway. The internal contact force distribution is determined numerically by using a symmetry 3D FEM-model of a large three-row roller slewing bearing. Another numerical procedure is used to determine the stress field in the contact area between rollers and raceway. This problem is studied on different roller types: cylindrical roller (without profile correction), fully crowned roller (logarithmic-profile) and partially crowned roller (ZB-profile). Numerically determined contact stresses then serve as a basis for fatigue analyses, where the bearing's service life of the bearing is determined by using the stress-life approach, considering typical material parameters of the bearing's raceway. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Epicyclic gearing or planetary gearing is a gear system that consists of one or more outer gears, or planet gears, revolving around a central, or sun gear. Typically, the planet gears are mounted on a movable arm or carrier, which itself may rotate relative to the sun gear. It is challenging to monitor epicyclic gearboxes, due to their complex structure consisting of many rolling elements. A complex structure and versatile components also result in a long stoppage if a failure occurs. Therefore, it is important to detect incipient faults at an early stage. In this paper, vibration analysis is used for the condition monitoring of an epicyclic gearbox at a water power station. There is a distinct difference between vibration quantities: vibration velocity responds very well to vibrations with frequencies less than 1000 Hz; an even better response is obtained when using acceleration and its higher derivatives, which also provide more information on higher frequencies. Because of the quite high rotational speed of the output, vibration velocity is not good enough for the condition monitoring of the gear in question. Acceleration and its higher order derivatives should be used in order to obtain better responsiveness to changes in the condition of the gearbox. Complex models based on mechanisms are needed in order to calculate the vibration components in the frequency range and to identify the possible faulty components. There was also one vibration component in the gear the source of which could not be discovered with certainty.},

From the experimental results, the dimensional exponent (an approximation of the correlation dimension) as computed from the partial correlation integral algorithm tends to increase as time progresses and the useful remaining life of the bearing is decreasing. The dimensional exponents of a healthy bearing and a bearing close to failure are statistically different. We also propose a computational scheme for bearing condition monitoring (diagnosis and prognosis) using the dimensional exponent integrated with a surrogate data testing technique. As a result, we can characterize the condition of the bearing from the results of the surrogate data test and furthermore, we provide some preliminary evidence that the dimensional exponent can be used to predict the failure of rolling element bearings in rotating machinery from real-time vibration data. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The vibration-based condition monitoring of planetary gears is a highly active and challenging field of research. Many signal processing techniques have been proposed with the aim of promoting the fault component in the signal and, consequently, highlight the fault signature (i.e. the damage symptom). Most of these techniques considers the fault contribution as being deterministic, which is true in the case of an advanced and localized faults. Such techniques may fail in other scenarii in which, for instance, the fault is of distributed nature and its vibrational component is weak. In such a case, the fault component is likely to be randomized and turns cyclostationary. The present paper suggests the presence of an additional cyclostationary component in planetary gear vibrations. The presence of this component is explained by the presence of load fluctuations at the meshing points and the random micro-irregularity in the gear component stiffness, as well as the presence of distributed faults. A simplified signal model is proposed to explain the vibration signal structure of a healthy and faulty (with planet fault) planetary gear. Also, a cyclostationary-based condition monitoring approach is proposed, being based on the cyclic coherence. The proposed approach is validated on a real-world vibration signals acquired from a planetary gear benchmark.},

abstract = {In rotating machine diagnosis, the squared envelope spectrum (SES) is one of the most efficient indicators of the presence of cyclostationarity, which is typical symptom of damages in rolling element bearing. Similarly to other cyclostationary tools, the SES should be applied on the pure random part of the signal otherwise spurious peaks may appear and hide the cyclostationary content. Therefore, conventional deterministic$\backslash$random separation (DRS) techniques are usually used as a pre-processing step to suppress the deterministic (periodic) component. In speed varying regimes, the SES is combined with computed order tracking to obtain an order-domain representation rather than a Hertzian one. Though being order tracked, the deterministic components undergo speed-dependent variations in their magnitude and phase, thus losing their periodicity. This necessarily invalidates the working assumption of conventional DRS techniques and, consequently, jeopardizes the efficiency of the SES. Lately, some sophisticated preprocessing techniques have been proposed to deal with this issue whereof the most important are the improved synchronous average (ISA), the cepstrum prewhitening (CPW) and the generalized synchronous average (GSA). This paper aims to provide a comparative study of these techniques by highlighting their pros and cons. The comparison is performed on real-word signals.},

abstract = {In complex machines, the failure signs of an early bearing damage are weak compared to other sources of excitations (e.g. gears, shafts, rotors, etc.). The task of emphasizing the failure signs is complicated by the fact that changes in operating conditions influence vibrations sources and change the frequency and amplitude characteristics of the signal, making it non-stationary. As a result, a joint time-frequency representation is required. Previous vibration based diagnostic techniques focused on either the time domain or the frequency domain. The proposed method suggests a different solution that applies image processing techniques to time-frequency or RPM-order representations (TFR) of the vibration signals in the orders-RPM domain. In the first stage, TFRs of healthy machines are used to create a baseline. The TFRs can be obtained using various methods (Wigner-Ville, wavelets, STFT, etc). In the next stage, the distance TFR between the inspected recording and the baseline is computed. In the third stage, the distance TFR is analyzed using ridge tracking and other image processing algorithms. In the fourth stage, the relations between the detected ridges are compared to the characteristic patterns of the bearing failure modes and the matching ridges are selected. The different stages of analysis: baselines, distance TFR, ridges detection and selection, are illustrated with actual data of damaged bearings. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Over recent years a significant amount of research has been undertaken to develop prognostic models that can be used to predict the remaining useful life of engineering assets. Implementations by industry have only had limited success. By design, models are subject to specific assumptions and approximations, some of which are mathematical, while others relate to practical implementation issues such as the amount of data required to validate and verify a proposed model. Therefore, appropriate model selection for successful practical implementation requires not only a mathematical understanding of each model type, but also an appreciation of how a particular business intends to utilise a model and its outputs. This paper discusses business issues that need to be considered when selecting an appropriate modelling approach for trial. It also presents classification tables and process flow diagrams to assist industry and research personnel select appropriate prognostic models for predicting the remaining useful life of engineering assets within their specific business environment. The paper then explores the strengths and weaknesses of the main prognostics model classes to establish what makes them better suited to certain applications than to others and summarises how each have been applied to engineering prognostics. Consequently, this paper should provide a starting point for young researchers first considering options for remaining useful life prediction.

For the linear, time-invariant case, examination of the associated eigenvalue problem reveals the well-defined structure of the vibration modes, where the special structure results from the cyclic symmetry of planetary gears. Vibration modes are classified into rotational, translational and planet modes. The unique characteristics of each type of mode are analytically investigated in detail.

abstract = {The need for a high fidelity model for design, analysis and implementation of an unmanned helicopter system (UHS) in various emerging civil applications cannot be underestimated. However, going by a first principle approach based on physical laws governing the dynamics of the system, this task is noted to be highly challenging due to the complex nonlinear characteristics of the helicopter system. On the other hand, the problem of determining network architecture for optimal/sub-optimal performances has been one of the major challenges in the use of the nonparametric approach based on Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs Network (NARX-network). The performance of the NARX network in terms of complexity and accuracy is largely dependent on the network architecture. The current approach in the literature has been largely based on trial and error, while most of the reported optimization approaches have limited the domain of the problem to a single objective problem. This study proposes a hybrid of conventional back propagation training algorithm for the NARX network and multiobjective differential evolution (MODE) algorithm for identification of a nonlinear model of an unmanned small scale helicopter from experimental flight data. The proposed hybrid algorithm was able to produce models with Pareto-optimal compromise between the design objectives. The performance of the proposed optimized model is benchmarked with one of the previously reported architectures for a similar system. The optimized model outperformed the previous model architecture with up to 55{\%} performance improvement. Apart from the effectiveness of the optimized model, the proposed design algorithm is expected to facilitate timely development of the nonparametric model of the helicopter system. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

By introducing the concepts of system-level, stage-level, and train-level relative phases, the relative phases between any two gear meshes in a compound planetary gear are calculated systematically. Important relations among these relative phases are derived.

abstract = {Vibration signals resulting from rolling element bearing defects, present a rich content of physical information, the appropriate analysis of which can lead to the clear identification of the nature of the fault. The envelope detection or demodulation methods have been established as the dominant analysis methods for this purpose, since they can separate the useful part of the signal from its redundant Contents. This paper proposes an effective demodulation method, based on the use of a complex shifted Morlet wavelet family. The method is designed in a way that can fully exploit the underlying physical concepts of the modulation mechanism, present in the vibration response of faulty bearings, using a time-frequency representation of the signal. A key element of the proposed method is the systematic introduction of selection criteria for the automated choice of the critical parameters that characterise the Morlet wavelet family used. Experimental results and industrial measurements for two different types of bearing faults confirm the validity of the overall approach. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

This trend allows data collected from machines in operation to interact with cyberspace computers through a communication network, thus forming the concept of cyber-physical systems (CPS). Besides, rapid advances in information and communications technologies provide approaches for analysing data, in an increasingly rapid, autonomously, ubiquitous and in real time way, providing information that assists humans in making better decisions. In this sense, Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) of machines, is indicated as a promising application of Smart Manufacturing in the CPS context, demanding the standardization of concepts, terms, and a formal implementation of data collection and treatment. For this purpose, the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology is used in this paper, encompassing international standards, the unified 5-level architecture, ontology, and dependability for failure analysis in mechanical components. In addition, the creation of an ontology using the OWL 2 language was guided by the ‘Ontology Development 101′ approach. A pilot test was carried out using a centrifugal pump to demonstrate the applicability of the ontology. Thus, the ontology is evaluated in Prot{\'{e}}g{\'{e}}, which allow queries with SPARQL language to provide future decision-making for condition-based maintenance in real processes.},

abstract = {The subject of machine condition monitoring is charged with developing new technologies to diagnose the machinery problems. Different methods of fault identification have been developed and used effectively to detect the machine faults at an early stage using different machine quantities, such as current, voltage, speed, efficiency, temperature and vibrations. One of the principal tools for diagnosing rotating machinery problems has been the vibration analysis. Through the use of different signal processing techniques, it is possible to obtain vital diagnostic information from vibration profile before the equipment catastrophically fails. A problem with diagnostic techniques is that they require constant human interpretation of the results. The logical progression of the condition monitoring technologies is the automation of the diagnostic process. The research has been underway for a long time to automate the diagnostic process. Recently, artificial intelligent tools, such as expert systems, neural network and fuzzy logic, have been widely used with the monitoring system to support the detection and diagnostic tasks. This paper reviews the progress made in electrical drive condition monitoring and diagnostic research and development in general and induction machine drive condition monitoring and diagnostic research and development, in particular, since its inception.

abstract = {Torsional vibration signals are theoretically free from the amplitude modulation effect caused by time variant vibration transfer paths due to the rotation of planet carrier and sun gear, and therefore their spectral structure are simpler than transverse vibration signals. Thus, it is potentially easy and effective to diagnose planetary gearbox faults via torsional vibration signal analysis. We give explicit equations to model torsional vibration signals, considering both distributed gear faults (like manufacturing or assembly errors) and local gear faults (like pitting, crack or breakage of one tooth), and derive the characteristics of both the traditional Fourier spectrum and the proposed demodulated spectra of amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency. These derivations are not only effective to diagnose single gear fault of planetary gearboxes, but can also be generalized to detect and locate multiple gear faults. We validate experimentally the signal models, as well as the Fourier spectral analysis and demodulation analysis methods. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, the high frequency resonance technique, used for many years in the early detection of failure in rolling element bearings by vibration analysis, is combined with the technique of synchronous averaging, which has long been applied to vibration analysis of gears for the early detection of failure. It is shown that by synchronizing the averaging of the envelope signal with a trigger signal taken from the rotation of the shaft, a representation is obtained for a bearing under radial load of the influence of the load distribution and the effects of the transfer path to the vibration transducer. By synchronizing with the rotation speed of the shaft relative to the cage, an estimate is obtained of the distribution of the damage on the inner race of the bearing, and of the variations between rolling elements. The techniques are demonstrated by experiments on a laboratory test rig with a rolling bearing under radial load and multiple simulated spalls on the inner race.},

Even though, the topic of how to leverage these ISE techniques to improve the data quality in terms of prognostics and health management (PHM) still needs to be investigated. In this work, a systematic view for data quality enhancement is presented. The data quality issues for the prognostics and health management (PHM) of rotating machinery are identified, and the major steps to enhance data quality are organized. Based on this, a novel ISE algorithm is originally proposed, the importance of extracting scale invariant features are explained, and also related features are proposed for the PHM of rotating machinery. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the novelties, two experimental studies are presented. The final results indicate that the proposed method can be effectively employed to enhance the data quality for machine failure detection and diagnosis.},

abstract = {The paper considers complex industrial systems with incomplete maintenance history. A corrective maintenance is performed after the occurrence of a failure and its efficiency is assumed to be imperfect. In maintenance analysis, the databases are not necessarily complete. Specifically, the observations are assumed to be window-censored. This situation arises relatively frequently after the purchase of a second-hand unit or in the absence of maintenance record during the burn-in phase. The joint assessment of the wear-out of the system and the maintenance efficiency is investigated under missing data. A review along with extensions of statistical inference procedures from an observation window are proposed in the case of perfect and minimal repair using the renewal and Poisson theories, respectively. Virtual age models are employed to model imperfect repair. In this framework, new estimation procedures are developed. In particular, maximum likelihood estimation methods are derived for the most classical virtual age models. The benefits of the new estimation procedures are highlighted by numerical simulations and an application to a real data set.},

abstract = {Rotational speed or phase measurements are important in the rotating machine condition monitoring field. Rotating machines often operate in the presence of fluctuating rotational speeds and its components generate signals which are periodical in the angle domain. Hence, it is essential to perform order tracking when condition monitoring is performed under varying speed conditions. Computed order tracking is performed with a measured tachometer signal and it requires additional hardware to be installed on the machine, which may not be feasible nor practical. This article presents a tacholess order tracking method which is capable of accurately estimating the phase of a shaft of interest in the presence of large angular accelerations and noise. An improved maxima tracking procedure is used with an angular-displacement Vold-Kalman filter and the Hilbert transform to estimate the instantaneous phase of the shaft under consideration. The estimated instantaneous phase is used to resample the vibration signal from the time to the angle domain. The proposed tacholess order tracking technique is critically investigated on three numerical and three experimental rotational speed profiles. The minimum and maximum phase error obtained for the experimental data was 0.037697 and 0.05022 radians respectively, which highlights the potential of the technique.},

abstract = {Health condition monitoring of rotating machinery is a crucial task to guarantee reliability in industrial processes. In particular, bearings are mechanical components used in most rotating devices and they represent the main source of faults in such equipments; reason for which research activities on detecting and diagnosing their faults have increased. Fault detection aims at identifying whether the device is or not in a fault condition, and diagnosis is commonly oriented towards identifying the fault mode of the device, after detection. An important step after fault detection and diagnosis is the analysis of the magnitude or the degradation level of the fault, because this represents a support to the decision-making process in condition based-maintenance. However, no extensive works are devoted to analyse this problem, or some works tackle it from the fault diagnosis point of view. In a rough manner, fault severity is associated with the magnitude of the fault. In bearings, fault severity can be related to the physical size of fault or a general degradation of the component. Due to literature regarding the severity assessment of bearing damages is limited, this paper aims at discussing the recent methods and techniques used to achieve the fault severity evaluation in the main components of the rolling bearings, such as inner race, outer race, and ball. The review is mainly focused on data-driven approaches such as signal processing for extracting the proper fault signatures associated with the damage degradation, and learning approaches that are used to identify degradation patterns with regards to health conditions. Finally, new challenges are highlighted in order to develop new contributions in this field.},

In order to avoid crowding out understanding of the methodology, a simple linear pitch-plane model is employed. Initially, road profiles from known roughness classes were applied to a physical model to calculate vehicle responses. The calculated responses and road profiles were used to train an artificial neural network. In this way, the network renders corresponding road profiles on the availability of fresh data on model responses. The results show that the road profiles and associated defects can be reconstructed to within a 20{\%} error at a minimum correlation value of 94{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2009 ISTVS.},

abstract = {A procedure is presented for fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings through artificial neural network (ANN). The characteristic features of time-domain vibration signals of the rotating machinery with normal and defective bearings have been used as inputs to the ANN consisting of input, hidden and output layers. The features are obtained from direct processing of the signal segments using very simple preprocessing. The input layer consists of five nodes, one each for root mean square, variance, skewness, kurtosis and normalised sixth central moment of the time-domain vibration signals. The inputs are normalised in the range of 0.0 and 1.0 except for the skewness which is normalised between -1.0 and 1.0. The output layer consists of two binary nodes indicating the status of the machine-normal or defective bearings. Two hidden layers with different number of neurons have been used. The ANN is trained using backpropagation algorithm with a subset of the experimental data for known machine conditions. The ANN is tested using the remaining set of data. The effects of some preprocessing techniques like high-pass, band-pass filtration, envelope detection (demodulation) and wavelet transform of the vibration signals, prior to feature extraction, are also studied. The results show the effectiveness of the ANN in diagnosis of the machine condition. The proposed procedure requires only a few features extracted from the measured vibration data either directly or with simple preprocessing. The reduced number of inputs leads to faster training requiring far less iterations making the procedure suitable for on-line condition monitoring and diagnostics of machines.},

abstract = {This paper presents a technique to differentially diagnose two localized gear tooth faults: a spall and a crack in the gear tooth fillet region. These faults could have very different prognoses, but existing diagnostic techniques only indicate the presence of local tooth faults without being able to differentiate between a spall and a crack. The effects of spalls and cracks on the behavior/response of gear assemblies were studied using static and dynamic simulation models. Changes in the kinematics of a pair of meshing gears due to a gear tooth root crack and a tooth flank spall were compared using a static analysis model. The difference in the variation of the transmission error caused by the two faults reveals their characteristics. The effect of a tooth crack depends on the change in stiffness of the tooth, while the effect of a spall is predominantly determined by the geometry of the fault. The effect of the faults on the gear dynamics was studied by simulating the transmission error in a lumped parameter dynamic model. A technique had previously been proposed to detect spalls, using the cepstrum to detect a negative echo in the signal (from entry into and exit from the spall). In the authors' simulations, echoes were detected with both types of fault, but their different characteristics should allow differential diagnosis. These concepts are presented prior to experimental validation in hopes that the diagnostic techniques will be useful in the failure analysis community prior to the validation by ongoing experimental testing of the concepts and the evaluation of how metallurgical defects may influence fault development and detection. {\textcopyright} ASM International.},

abstract = {This paper examines the views of pre-service and in-service teachers with regard to the sources of students' mathematical difficulties. A group of 40 pre-service mathematics, 15 in-service mathematics and 15 in-service elementary teachers participated in this study. Questionnaires are used as data collection tools to see what the participants think about the sources of student difficulties. The notion of "obstacles to learning" is used as a framework to analyze the collected data. The analysis is carried out on the basis of three main categories to which participant teachers attribute students' difficulties: epistemological causes, psychological causes and pedagogical causes. The data analysis reveals that both pre-service and in-service teachers tend to attribute students' difficulties to student-related factors, namely psychological causes. We discuss the findings in terms of these three sources of learning difficulties, educational implications and note the usefulness of the employing the "obstacles to learning framework" in examining not only students' learning difficulties but also Teachers' views of the sources for student difficulties.},

Reliability of wind turbine is critical to extract this maximum amount of energy from the wind. We reviewed different techniques, methodologies and algorithms developed to monitor the performance of wind turbine as well as for an early fault detection to keep away the wind turbines from catastrophic conditions due to sudden breakdowns. To keep the wind turbine in operation, implementation of condition monitoring system (CMS) and fault detection system (FDS) is paramount and for this purpose ample knowledge of these two types of systems is mandatory. So, an attempt has been made in this direction to review maximum approaches related to CMS and FDS in this piece of writing. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper concerns the use of neural networks for predicting the residual life of machines and components. In addition, the advantage of using condition-monitoring data to enhance the predictive capability of these neural networks was also investigated. A number of neural network variations were trained and tested with the data of two different reliability-related datasets. The first dataset represents the renewal case where the failed unit is repaired and restored to a good-as-new condition. Data were collected in the laboratory by subjecting a series of similar test pieces to fatigue loading with a hydraulic actuator. The average prediction error of the various neural networks being compared varied from 431 to 841 s on this dataset, where test pieces had a characteristic life of 8971 s. The second dataset were collected from a group of pumps used to circulate a water and magnetite solution within a plant. The data therefore originated from a repaired system affected by reliability degradation. When optimized, the multi-layer perceptron neural networks trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and the general regression neural network produced a sum-of-squares error within 11.1{\%} of each other for the renewal dataset. The small number of inputs and poorly mapped input space on the second dataset meant that much larger errors were recorded on some of the test data. The potential for using neural networks for residual life prediction and the advantage of incorporating condition-based data into the model was nevertheless proven for both examples. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We show how the success of deep learning could depend not only on mathematics but also on physics: although well-known mathematical theorems guarantee that neural networks can approximate arbitrary functions well, the class of functions of practical interest can frequently be approximated through "cheap learning" with exponentially fewer parameters than generic ones. We explore how properties frequently encountered in physics such as symmetry, locality, compositionality, and polynomial log-probability translate into exceptionally simple neural networks. We further argue that when the statistical process generating the data is of a certain hierarchical form prevalent in physics and machine-learning, a deep neural network can be more efficient than a shallow one. We formalize these claims using information theory and discuss the relation to the renormalization group. We prove various "no-flattening theorems" showing when efficient linear deep networks cannot be accurately approximated by shallow ones without efficiency loss, for example, we show that {\$}n{\$} variables cannot be multiplied using fewer than 2{\^{}}n neurons in a single hidden layer.},

The analysis results of this work for dynamic analysis of rotors are compared to those available in the literature. An excellent agreement is observed, which validates the formulation and implementation of the model developed. Further analysis is conducted for rotors with oil-film bearings. The stability of the system is studied by examining the real parts of the eigenvalues and the logarithmic decrement. The sequential quadratic programming technique is used for the minimum weight design. The effect of minimum weight design on the distribution of rotor shape, weight saving, and system stability is examined. It is demonstrated that significant reduction of rotor weight can be achieved. Weight reduction of more than 80{\%} is possible for a simple rotor analyzed, whereas for a realistic complex rotor with oil-lubricated bearings, an original rotor weight of 5.4886kg can be reduced to 1.7267kg after being optimized. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsev ier Science B.V.

Contamination in the fluid in terms of solid particles and chemically reactive substances causes damage to the impeller, casing, and seals. A defect in bearing due to improper lubrication, adverse loading and manufacturing defect may also affect the performance of the pump. Hence there is a need to develop a reliable procedure for defect identification in the centrifugal pump. A robust automated signal processing algorithm is proposed for the purpose. Features sensitive to defective conditions are extracted from raw signal and scale marginal integration graph. The genetic algorithm (GA) is used to find the optimal parameters of support vector machine (SVM). Using the optimal parameters, training of SVM is carried out for the learning of defective conditions of the pump. After training, features are applied to SVM for the identification of the defective condition of the pump. The performance evaluation of the proposed method is made using receiver operating characteristics graph and is found to be reliable. The overall recognition rate of the proposed method in identifying the specific conditions of the pump is 96.66{\%}. In this work, an attempt is also been made to reduce the training time of GA-SVM model.},

However, great challenges are met by the AI methods under the different real operating conditions. This paper attempts to present a comprehensive review of AI algorithms in rotating machinery fault diagnosis, from both the views of theory background and industrial applications. A brief introduction of different AI algorithms is presented first, including the following methods: k-nearest neighbour, naive Bayes, support vector machine, artificial neural network and deep learning. Then, a broad literature survey of these AI algorithms in industrial applications is given. Finally, the advantages, limitations, practical implications of different AI algorithms, as well as some new research trends, are discussed.},

In recent years, these networks have become the state-of-the-art models for a variety of machine learning problems. This has led to a renewed interest in understanding the role and utility of various computational components of typical LSTM variants. In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of eight LSTM variants on three representative tasks: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and polyphonic music modeling. The hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task were optimized separately using random search, and their importance was assessed using the powerful fANOVA framework. In total, we summarize the results of 5400 experimental runs ({\$}\backslashapprox 15{\$} years of CPU time), which makes our study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks. Our results show that none of the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture significantly, and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function to be its most critical components. We further observe that the studied hyperparameters are virtually independent and derive guidelines for their efficient adjustment.},

abstract = {A reliable dynamic model that predicts the vibrations of a gear transmission containing a fault may allow us to recognize the effects of that fault, to identify its severity, and to develop methods for characterizing its type by using a limited number of experiments. In this research, a new generic model for gear dynamics is proposed. This model is solved numerically, and combines the most advanced approaches for gear modeling, including: modeling the contact between gear pairs as a set of springs, modeling the effect of faults on the mesh stiffness, and integrating the geometric errors. As a result, the model simulates successfully the acceleration signal of a realistic gear pair in a realistic environment. In this paper, we present a different approach to simulate partial tooth face faults, which takes into account the partial contact loss along the tooth contact line due to the fault's geometry. We propose a new analytical formulation for modeling complete tooth face faults that are located across the entire contact area. Additionally, a modified analytical expression for describing the tooth profile errors is proposed. Using a realistic simulation, we were able to experimentally validate the model.},

Given the significance of prognostics capabilities and the maturity of condition monitoring technology, there have been an increasing number of publications on rotating machinery prognostics in the past few years. These publications covered a wide spectrum of prognostics techniques. This review article first synthesises and places these individual pieces of information in context, while identifying their merits and weaknesses. It then discusses the identified challenges, and in doing so, alerts researchers to opportunities for conducting advanced research in the field. Current methods for predicting rotating machinery failures are summarised and classified as conventional reliability models, condition-based prognostics models and models integrating reliability and prognostics. Areas in need of development or improvement include the integration of condition monitoring and reliability, utilisation of incomplete trending data, consideration of effects from maintenance actions and variable operating conditions, derivation of the non-linear relationship between measured data and actual asset health, consideration of failure interactions, practicability of requirements and assumptions, as well as development of performance evaluation frameworks.

This paper proposes a remaining life adaptation methodology based on mechanistic modeling and parameter tuning. Vibration measurement is used to estimate defect severity by monitoring the signals generated from rotating bearings. Through a defect propagation model and defect diagnostic model, an adaptive algorithm is developed to fine tune the parameters involved in the propagation model by comparing predicted and measured defect sizes. In this manner, the instantaneous rate of defect propagation can be captured despite defect growth behavior variation. Therefore, a precise estimation of the remaining life can be determined. Simulations and experimental results are presented to illustrate the implementation principles and to verify the applicability of the adaptive prognostic methodology.},

Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.Nonlinear metamaterials provide a host of interesting phenomena which, like for their linear counterpart, can be described using homogenized, effective properties. Following the convention used in nonlinear optics, the response of nonlinear metamaterials can be expressed as a power series of the incident fields. However, contrarily to most materials used in nonlinear optics that only possess an electric nonlinear response, nonlinear metamaterials often showelectric, magnetic, and magnetoelectric nonlinear responses within a single unit cell. In this chapter, we present two complementary approaches to determine all the effective nonlinear susceptibilities of nonlinear metamaterials. First we present a coupled-mode theory that provides insight into the origin of the various nonlinear susceptibilities that arise in nonlinear metamaterials according to the symmetry of the unit cell. This approach also leads to a description of the effect of the finite size of the unit cells, often called spatial dispersion. Second, we present a retrieval approach based on transfer matrices that can be used to determine the effective nonlinear susceptibilities from either simulated or experimental results. We finally demonstrate how to use this approach by applying it to the case of dual-gap varactor-loaded split ring resonators.},

Bearings with distributed faults tend to generate more complex vibration patterns than those with localized faults. Despite the frequent occurrence of such faults, their diagnosis has attracted limited attention. This paper examines a method for the diagnosis of distributed bearing faults employing vibration analysis. The vibrational patterns generated are modeled by incorporating the geometrical imperfections of the bearing components. Comparing envelope spectra of vibration signals shows that one can distinguish between localized and distributed faults. Furthermore, a diagnostic procedure for the detection of distributed faults is proposed. This is evaluated on several bearings with naturally born distributed faults, which are compared with fault-free bearings and bearings with localized faults. It is shown experimentally that features extracted from vibrations in fault-free, localized and distributed fault conditions form clearly separable clusters, thus enabling diagnosis.},

abstract = {System management includes the selection of maintenance actions depending on the available observations: when a system is made up by components known to be similar, data collected on one is also relevant for the management of others. This is typically the case of wind farms, which are made up by similar turbines. Optimal management of wind farms is an important task due to high cost of turbines' operation and maintenance: in this context, we recently proposed a method for planning and learning at system-level, called PLUS, built upon the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework, which treats transition and emission probabilities as random variables, and is therefore suitable for including model uncertainty. PLUS models the components as independent or identical. In this paper, we extend that formulation, allowing for a weaker similarity among components. The proposed approach, called Multiple Uncertain POMDP (MU-POMDP), models the components as POMDPs, and assumes the corresponding parameters as dependent random variables. Through this framework, we can calibrate specific degradation and emission models for each component while, at the same time, process observations at system-level. We compare the performance of the proposed MU-POMDP with PLUS, and discuss its potential and computational complexity.},

abstract = {Bearing failure is one of the foremost causes of breakdowns in rotating machinery and such failure can be catastrophic, resulting in costly downtime. One of the key issues in bearing prognostics is to detect the defect at its incipient stage and alert the operator before it develops into a catastrophic failure. Signal de-noising and extraction of the weak signature are crucial to bearing prognostics since the inherent deficiency of the measuring mechanism often introduces a great amount of noise to the signal. In addition, the signature of a defective bearing is spread across a wide frequency band and hence can easily become masked by noise and low frequency effects. As a result, robust methods are needed to provide more evident information for bearing performance assessment and prognostics. This paper introduces enhanced and robust prognostic methods for rolling element bearing including a wavelet filter based method for weak signature enhancement for fault identification and Self Organizing Map (SOM) based method for performance degradation assessment. The experimental results demonstrate that the bearing defects can be detected at an early stage of development when both optimal wavelet filter and SOM method are used. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Laser Doppler vibrometry enables the telemetry-free measurement of online turbomachinery blade vibration. Specifically, the Eulerian or fixed reference frame implementation of laser vibrometry provides a practical solution to the condition monitoring of rotating blades. The short data samples that are characteristic of this measurement approach do however negate the use of traditional frequency domain signal processing techniques. It is therefore necessary to employ techniques such as time domain analysis and non-harmonic Fourier analysis to obtain useful information from the blade vibration signatures. The latter analysis technique allows the calculation of phase angle trends which can be used as indicators of blade health deterioration, as has been shown in previous work for a single-blade rotor. This article presents the results from tests conducted on a five-blade axial-flow test rotor at different rotor speeds and measurement positions. With the aid of artificial neural networks, it is demonstrated that the parameters obtained from non-harmonic Fourier analysis and time domain signal processing on Eulerian laser Doppler vibrometry signals can successfully be used to identify and quantify blade damage from among healthy blades. It is also shown that the natural frequencies of individual blades can be approximated from the Eulerian signatures recorded during rotor run-up and run-down. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In many complex mechanical systems (drive unit with multi-stage gearbox) there is a chance to find a multi faults problem. These faults may appear in different location, they may represent different type of fault and generate different signals with different amplitudes, frequency content and statistical properties. Most of proposed in the literature techniques concern nearly "ideal" condition of all components in machine and introduced artificially one type of fault (mainly local damage) at particular location (often experiments are done on test stands). In the paper a different case will be considered as an example of real problem of condition monitoring in normal (nonstationary) operation in industrial environment. A comprehensive description of machine with multi faults problem will be shown. A scheme of signal processing for fault diagnosis will be proposed. Proposed scheme consist of: detection of multi-faults problem (Spectral Correlation Density), specific Signal of Interest extraction, fault detection and recognition and change of condition estimation and life time prognosis. Machines work under non-stationary load, consequently signals are non-stationary, too (in sense of time varying amplitudes and frequency content). Time varying (load dependent) signals/features require multidimensional analysis (features and operating condition indicators). SCD doesn't contain information about time (it is function of two frequencies). Components on SCD plane are averaged (like in classic spectrum). It usually gives a chance to detect faults, however in order to estimate fault development one needs to take into account influence of size of damage and load/speed value.},

Compared with multi-scale fuzzy entropy (MFE) method, HFE method considers both the low and high frequency components of the vibration signals, which can provide a much more accurate estimation of entropy. Besides, Laplacian score (LS) method is introduced to refine the fault feature by sorting the scale factors. Subsequently, the obtained features are fed into the multi-fault classifier ISVM-BT to automatically fulfill the fault pattern identifications.

The methodology uses the wavelet packet transform, order tracking and a feature modelling approach to generate a diagnostic metric in the form of a discrepancy measure.

Processing of the experimental results enabled (i) various autoregressive (AR) spectrum analysis methods and especially Burg's algorithm to be tested and (ii) conventional spectrum analysis techniques such as the correlogram to be compared with parametric methods in terms of detection level as well as for mechanical component fault monitoring, especially ball bearing defects. Among various possible models, the AR model was retained along with Burg's algorithm and the Akaike information criterion. A detection and location methodology for faults likely to occur on rotating machinery was developed on the basis of the results that were obtained. The methodology, supplementing other analysis techniques, relies on the understanding of component spectrum behavior and various constraints, such as component access, spectral resolution of the industrial measuring device, and statistical properties of the power spectral density measurements of a random signal. The results show that parametric methods are particularly worthwhile in the early detection of component defects, especially when two characteristic frequencies are close to one another. However, the complexity of these techniques necessitates many precautions when they are implemented; consequently, they should not replace conventional methods, but supplement them. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Fixed frequency content (i.e. component or structural resonances) in spectra obtained from rotating equipment can be masked by the strong sources at harmonics (order) of the shaft running speed. The ratio of the fixed frequency components to the order components can be greater than 60dB making interpretation of resonances in the spectra difficult. Hence the order components are viewed as a corrupting phenomenon. An approach to remove the order components from the spectra, without affecting the remaining frequency domain information is presented in this work. The technique utilises a sequence of data sampling and transformations, between the time, order and frequency domains as follows:(1) Vibration data is sampled using a constant time basis ($\Delta$t).(2) The times corresponding to a constant angular basis ($\Delta$$\theta$) are determined.(3) The vibration data is interpolated to a constant angular basis ($\Delta$$\theta$).(4) The constant angle sampled data is transformed via the FFT to the order domain.(5) The high amplitude order components are now exactly bin centred and can be removed from the spectra.(6) An inverse FFT is applied to return to a constant angular increment sampled ($\Delta$$\theta$) array, sans order content.(7) The constant angular increment sampled ($\Delta$$\theta$) array is interpolated to an array sampled with constant time basis ($\Delta$t).(8) A FFT is applied and then standard spectral estimation procedures used to compute the vibration spectra with the high-level orders removed. The theoretical and implementation details of the double resampling approach are discussed. The approach is applied to experimental torsional vibration data acquired from a laboratory test rig designed to simulate a turbine rotor. The test results show that the method can recover fixed frequency components (i.e. turbine blade natural frequencies) in the presence of order components 50dB higher. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose a progressive inverse identification algorithm to characterize flow stress of tubular materials from the material response, independent of choosing an a priori hardening constitutive model. Design/methodology/approach: In contrast to the conventional forward flow stress identification methods, the flow stress is characterized by a multi-linear curve rather than a limited number of hardening model parameters. The proposed algorithm optimizes the slopes and lengths of the curve increments simultaneously. The objective of the optimization is that the finite element (FE) simulation response of the test estimates the material response within a predefined accuracy. Findings: The authors employ the algorithm to identify flow stress of a 304 stainless steel tube in a tube bulge test as an example to illustrate application of the algorithm. Comparing response of the FE simulation using the obtained flow stress with the material response shows that the method can accurately determine the flow stress of the tube. Practical implications: The obtained flow stress can be employed for more accurate FE simulation of the metal forming processes as the material behaviour can be characterized in a similar state of stress as the target metal forming process. Moreover, since there is no need for a priori choosing the hardening model, there is no risk for choosing an improper hardening model, which in turn facilitates solving the inverse problem. Originality/value: The proposed algorithm is more efficient than the conventional inverse flow stress identification methods. In the latter, each attempt to select a more accurate hardening model, if it is available, result in constructing an entirely new inverse problem. However, this problem is avoided in the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {The last decade has witnessed spectacular advances in vibration-based fault detection of rotating machines and, in particular, rolling element bearings. Nowadays, the related state of the art can be considered mature thanks to a set of powerful signal processing techniques able to denoise and process the vibration signal to detect fault symptoms. Among these techniques, two emerging approaches have specifically captured the interest of the scientific community thanks to their efficiency and robustness. They have also been recommended in the bearing diagnostic tutorial written by professors R. B. Randall {\&} J. Antoni, published in MSSP in 2011. The first approach consists of pre-processing the random part of the vibration signal (after removal of deterministic components) through the minimum entropy deconvolution (MED) method, followed by the spectral kurtosis (SK), before analyzing the spectrum of the signal envelope. The MED enhances the signal impulsivity by deconvolving the system transfer function through an optimization approach that maximizes the kurtosis of the filter output. Then, the SK is applied to conceive the optimal filter that promotes the most informative spectral band before computing the (squared) envelope spectrum. The second approach is based on a cyclostationary modeling of the bearing signal. It applies a bi-variable map— called the spectral coherence— of (i) the cyclic frequency, which describes the cyclic content of modulations, and (ii) the spectral frequency which describes the spectral content of the carrier. When applied to the random part of the signal, this quantity is able to detail the signal in this plane according to the signal-to-noise ratio, thus allowing weak fault components to appear in the distribution. This paper investigates and compares these two approaches on real bearing vibration datasets including run-to-failure tests. The study also addresses the extension of these approaches to the nonstationary operating regime.},

abstract = {High contact ratio gears have been demonstrated to provide significant advantages for decreasing tooth root and contact stresses with potential flow-on benefits for increased load carrying capacity. Previous investigations with high contact ratio gears have involved analytical, numerical and experimental aspects. Much of the earlier numerical work using FEA was limited in its usefulness due to several factors; (i) the difficulty in predicting load sharing over roll angles covering two or three teeth simultaneously in mesh, (ii) the difficulty for the analysis to obtain quality results when modelling Hertzian contact deflection simultaneously with the bending, shear and angular deflections, and (iii) the problem of primary unconstrained body motion when (long) profile modifications were applied. This paper presents methods and results for overcoming these difficulties with recent computer hardware and software improvements. Particular developments discussed include the use of FE analysis of High Contact Ratio Gears in mesh and the results obtained when adaptive meshing is used. The details of transmission error, combined torsional mesh stiffness, load-sharing ratio, contact stress and tooth root stress against various input loads over a complete mesh cycle are also given. Results with various tooth profile modifications are presented and comparisons between the results show evidence for the optimal profile modification expected to gain the maximum benefit of HCRG.},

In developing an iterative neural network technique for model updating of structures, it has been shown that the number of training samples required increases exponentially as the number of parameters to be updated increases. Training the neural network using these samples becomes a time-consuming task. In this study, we investigate the use of orthogonal arrays for the sample selection. A comparison between this orthogonal arrays method and four other methods is illustrated by two numerical examples. One is the update of the felxural rigidities of a simply supported beam and the other is the update of the material properties and the boundary conditions of a circular plate. The results indicate that the orthogonal arrays method can significantly reduce the number of training samples without affecting too much the accuracy of the neural network prediction. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Introduction. Systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and arterial thickening contribute to the elevated cardiovascular risk of dialysis patients. However, the course of these derangements and their relative contribution to the cardiovascular risk of nondialysed chronic kidney disease (CKD) are scarcely investigated.Methods. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and intima-media thickness (IMT) were assessed in 304 nondialysed CKD patients Stages 1-5 (mean age 46 ± 12 years, 158 men), together with routine biochemical measurements, C-reactive protein (CRP) and insulin resistance. Patients were then followed for time-to-event analysis of cardiovascular outcomes (fatal and nonfatal).Results. CRP and IMT increased, while FMD decreased in parallel with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline (P {\textless} 0.001 for all). CRP and intact parathormone, as well as eGFR, appeared as strong determinants of FMD and IMT in multivariate analyses. After a median follow-up of 41 (range 6-46) months, 30 fatal and 59 nonfatal cardiovascular events occurred. In univariate analysis, FMD, IMT and CRP were significant predictors of outcome. In a multivariate Cox model excluding IMT, both FMD [hazard ratios 0.52 (95{\%} confidence intervals 0.37-0.73) per {\%}] and CRP [1.07 (1.03-1.11) per mg/L] predicted cardiovascular outcomes independently of confounders. In a model excluding FMD, only CRP (and not IMT) was a significant predictor.Conclusions. Endothelial dysfunction, arterial thickening and inflammation occur in parallel with the decline in eGFR, contributing to the increased cardiovascular risk of nondialysed CKD. Our results support the use of FMD over IMT measurements to monitor nondialysed CKD patients at risk. {\textcopyright} The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of ERA-EDTA.

abstract = {Order tracking is one of the most important vibration analysis techniques for diagnosing faults in rotating machinery. It can be performed in many different ways, each of these with distinct advantages and disadvantages. However, in the end the analyst will often use Fourier analysis to transform the data from a time series to frequency or order spectra. It is therefore surprising that the study of the Fourier analysis of order-tracked systems seems to have been largely ignored in the literature. This paper considers the frequently used VoldKalman filter-based order tracking and computed order tracking techniques. The main pros and cons of each technique for Fourier analysis are discussed and the sequential use of VoldKalman filtering and computed order tracking is proposed as a novel idea to enhance the results of Fourier analysis for determining the order components. The advantages of the combined use of these order tracking techniques are demonstrated numerically on an SDOF rotor simulation model. Finally, the approach is also demonstrated on experimental data from a real rotating machine. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) is a multidisciplinary field aiming at maintaining physical systems in their optimal functioning conditions. The system under study is assumed to be monitored by sensors from which are obtained measurements reflecting the system's health state. A health indicator (HI) is estimated to feed a data-driven PHM solution developed to predict the remaining useful life (RUL). In this paper, the values taken by an HI are assumed imprecise (IHI). An IHI is interpreted as a planar figure called polygon and a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach is adapted to estimate the RUL. This adaptation makes use of computational geometry tools in order to estimate the nearest cases to a given testing instance. The proposed algorithm called RULCLIPPER is assessed and compared on datasets generated by the NASA's turbofan simulator (C-MAPSS) including the four turbofan testing datasets and the two testing datasets of the PHM'08 data challenge. These datasets represent 1360 testing instances and cover different realistic and difficult cases considering operating conditions and fault modes with unknown characteristics. The problem of feature selection, health indicator estimation, RUL fusion and ensembles are also tackled. The proposed algorithm is shown to be efficient with few parameter tuning on all datasets.},

abstract = {Historical fault data are often difficult and expensive to acquire, which can prohibit the application of supervised learning techniques in the condition-based maintenance field. Hence, novelty detection techniques such as discrepancy analysis are useful because only healthy historical data are required. However, even if discrepancy analysis is implemented on a machine, some historical fault data will become available during the operational lifetime of the machine and could be utilised to improve the efficiency of the condition inference process. An open set recognition methodology relying on discrepancy analysis is proposed that is capable of detecting novelties when only healthy historical data are available. It is also capable of inferring the condition of the machine if historical fault data are available and it is further able to detect novelties in regions not well supported by the historical fault data. In the condition recognition procedure, Gaussian mixture models are used with Bayes' rule and a decision rule to infer the condition of the machine in an open set recognition framework, where it is emphasised that it is beneficial to use the complete datasets (i.e. data acquired throughout the life of the component) for optimising the models. The benefit of the open set recognition model is that it is easy to incorporate new historical data in the framework as the data become available. In this work, practical aspects of the condition inference process such as the importance of good decision boundaries are highlighted and discussed as well. The methodology is validated on a synthetic dataset and experimental datasets acquired under varying operating conditions and it is also compared to a conventional classification process where discrepancy analysis is not used. The results indicate the potential of using the proposed methodology for rotating machine diagnostics under varying operating conditions.},

abstract = {In traditional intelligent fault diagnosis methods of machines, plenty of actual effort is taken for the manual design of fault features, which makes these methods less automatic. Among deep learning techniques, autoencoders may be a potential tool for automatic feature extraction of mechanical signals. However, traditional autoencoders have two following shortcomings. (1) They may learn similar features in mechanical feature extraction. (2) The learned features have shift variant properties, which leads to the misclassification of mechanical health conditions. To overcome the aforementioned shortcomings, a local connection network (LCN) constructed by normalized sparse autoencoder (NSAE), namely NSAE-LCN, is proposed for intelligent fault diagnosis. We construct LCN by input layer, local layer, feature layer and output layer. When raw vibration signals are fed to the input layer, LCN first uses NSAE to locally learn various meaningful features from input signals in the local layer, then obtains shift-invariant features in the feature layer and finally recognizes mechanical health conditions in the output layer. Thus, NSAE-LCN incorporates feature extraction and fault recognition into a general-purpose learning procedure. A gearbox dataset and a bearing dataset are used to validate the performance of the proposed NSAE-LCN. The results indicate that the learned features of NSAE are meaningful and dissimilar, and LCN helps to produce shift-invariant features and recognizes mechanical health conditions effectively. Through comparing with commonly used diagnosis methods, the superiority of the proposed NSAE-LCN is verified.},

abstract = {Given the advancements in modern technological capabilities, having an integrated health management and diagnostic strategy becomes an important part of a system's operational life-cycle. This is because it can be used to detect anomalies, analyse failures and predict the future state based on up-to-date information. By utilising condition data and on-site feedback, data models can be trained using machine learning and statistical concepts. Once trained, the logic for data processing can be embedded on on-board controllers whilst enabling real-time health assessment and analysis. However, this integration inevitably faces several difficulties and challenges for the community; indicating the need for novel approaches to address this vexing issue. Deep learning has gained increasing attention due to its potential advantages with data classification and feature extraction problems. It is an evolving research area with diverse application domains and hence its use for system health management applications must been researched if it can be used to increase overall system resilience or potential cost benefits for maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities. This article presents a systematic review of artificial intelligence based system health management with an emphasis on recent trends of deep learning within the field. Various architectures and related theories are discussed to clarify its potential. Based on the reviewed work, deep learning demonstrates plausible benefits for fault diagnosis and prognostics. However, there are a number of limitations that hinder its widespread adoption and require further development. Attention is paid to overcoming these challenges, with future opportunities being enumerated.},

abstract = {The rolling element bearing is the leading cause of failures in rotating machinery; on that account, the accurate prediction of its remaining useful life (RUL) using sensor data is an important challenge to improve the reliability and decrease the maintenance costs. Classical data-driven approaches rely on manually extracted features from raw sensor data followed by an estimation of a health indicator, the degradation states and the prediction of RUL using a failure threshold. Based on the recent success of deep neural networks in various artificial intelligence domains, we propose an end-To-end deep framework for RUL estimation based on convolutional and long-short-Term memory (LSTM) recurrent units. First the neural network extracts the local features directly from sensor data using the convolutional layer, then an LSTM layer is introduced to capture the degradation process, finally the RUL is estimated using the LSTM outputs and the prediction time value. Experiments are conducted on the ball bearing data provided by FEMTO-ST Institute. The results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach.},

abstract = {In cooperation with the major propulsion engine manufacturers, the authors are developing and demonstrating a unique very high frequency (VHF) vibration monitoring system that integrates various vibro- acoustic data with intelligent feature extraction and fault isolation algorithms to effectively assess engine gearbox and generator health. The system is capable of reporting on the early detection and progression of faults by utilizing piezoelectric, optical, and acoustic frequency measurements for improved, incipient anomaly detection. These gas turbine engine vibration monitoring technologies will address existing operation and maintenance goals for current military system and prognostics health management algorithms for advanced engines. These system features will be integrated in a state-of-the-art vibration monitoring system that will not only identify faults more confidently and at an earlier stage, but also enable the prediction of the time-to-failure or a degraded condition worthy of maintenance action. The authors have made significant progress toward identifying, computing, and comparing the high frequency feature sets generated with various vibro- acoustic measurement techniques. Specifically, the technology has been demonstrated on two subscale test stands. The first is a generator test rig that was equipped with a laser vibrometer and two high-frequency accelerometers. Various mechanical and electrical faults were seeded, with an emphasis on generator bearing faults. Initial results show very good detection capability in frequency bands well above those used in traditional vibration analysis. Another focus, accessory gearbox systems, was addressed for feasibility through a gearbox test rig, which was instrumented with high bandwidth accelerometers and wideband and narrowband acoustic emissions (AE) sensors. Baseline, seeded fault, and fault progression tests were conducted, including tests with various levels of gear tooth corrosion. Successful detection of this fault was then demonstrated using a number of new, innovative approaches. A statistical analysis was also performed to compare the approaches, with narrowband acoustic emission and high frequency vibration features performing the best.},

The waveform of the data in the propagation channel for the fault condition recognition is designed with the kurtosis of the measured data in time domain. The sequential hypothesis testing framework is proposed when hard decisions are made with adequate confidence. The distinguished characteristic of the channel recognition is that it operates in a closed loop and makes constant optimization in response to its changing understanding of the channel.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The approach is based upon the classical one-degree-of-freedom model, with backlash and time varying stiffness. Manufacturing errors are treated stochastically, starting from the knowledge of the gear tolerance class. A random profile error distribution is given for each tooth; then teeth errors are combined in order to span all possible reciprocal teeth contacts. The result is an analytical forcing, in terms of transmission error, which includes statistically the effect of local errors. Finally, a full dynamic analysis is carried out in the case of perfect and imperfect gears, in order to show the effect of profile errors and their variance on the gear vibration. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {White etching cracks (WECs) have been found to form in rolling element bearings as early as 6-24 months into operation, especially in large wind turbine gearboxes. Despite the number of investigations conducted in both industrial and academic research over the past two to three decades, WEC formation and initiation mechanisms are still not well understood. This is due to the complexity of the factors that influence WEC formation, such as speed, load (mechanical and electrical) and lubrication, as well as a lack of effective monitoring techniques that can detect WECs prior to severe bearing failures, such as spalls on the bearing surface. Recent research has suggested that WECs can form in rolling element bearings under the influence of electrical load (potential or current). To investigate the feasibility of WEC detection using the electrostatic (ES) sensing technique, an ES wear site sensor was installed on a bearing test-rig where WECs had been created under the influence of electrical load. The ES responses were compared with those from an acoustic emission (AE) sensor that had been shown to detect WEC failures in a previous study. The physical findings related to WEC failures in the bearings and basic analysis of the sensor signals have been reported in a parallel paper by Zuercher et al. This paper focuses on the analysis of ES and AE signals using a time-frequency method, where correlations between the electrostatic charge signals and AE measurements are found. The results suggest that electrostatic sensors have the potential to detect WEC formation in rolling element bearings.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE. Surface wear is one of the main failure modes that gears suffer from due to the sliding contact in the mesh process. However, the existing gear prognostics methods mainly focused on the fatigue cracking failure mode and the existing prediction methods considering surface wear are physics based without utilizing condition monitoring data. This paper proposes the first integrated prognostics method for failure time prediction of gears subject to the surface wear failure mode, utilizing both physical models, i.e., Archard's wear model and condition monitoring data, i.e., inspection data on gear mass loss in this study. By noticing the importance of the wear coefficient in Archard's model, the proposed method can result in a more accurate value of the wear coefficient so that the wear evolution in the future is forecasted with more accuracy. To achieve this, a Bayesian update process is implemented to incorporate the mass loss observation at an inspection point to determine the posterior distribution of the wear coefficient. With more mass loss data available, this posterior distribution gets narrower and its mean approaches the actual value of the coefficient. To use Archard' model, the gear mesh geometry and Hertz contact theory are applied to compute the sliding distance and the contact pressure for different points on the tooth flank. The proposed method is validated using run-to-failure experiments with a planetary gearbox test rig.},

However, effective condition-based maintenance (CBM) optimization methods utilizing ANN prediction information are currently not available due to two key challenges: (i) ANN prediction models typically only give a single remaining life prediction value, and it is hard to quantify the uncertainty associated with the predicted value; (ii) simulation methods are generally used for evaluating the cost of the CBM policies, while more accurate and efficient numerical methods are not available, which is critical for performing CBM optimization. In this paper, we propose a CBM optimization approach based on ANN remaining life prediction information, in which the above-mentioned key challenges are addressed. The CBM policy is defined by a failure probability threshold value. The remaining life prediction uncertainty is estimated based on ANN lifetime prediction errors on the test set during the ANN training and testing processes. A numerical method is developed to evaluate the cost of the proposed CBM policy more accurately and efficiently. Optimization can be performed to find the optimal failure probability threshold value corresponding to the lowest maintenance cost. The effectiveness of the proposed CBM approach is demonstrated using two simulated degradation data sets and a real-world condition monitoring data set collected from pump bearings. The proposed approach is also compared with benchmark maintenance policies and is found to outperform the benchmark policies. The proposed CBM approach can also be adapted to utilize information obtained using other prognostics methods. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

The machine condition is assessed through a suitable 'monitoring index' extracted from the vibration signals. The progression of the monitoring index is predicted using an SC technique, namely adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Comparison with a machine learning method, namely support vector regression (SVR), is also presented. The proposed prediction procedures have been evaluated through benchmark data sets. The prognostic effectiveness of the techniques has been illustrated through previously published data on several types of faults in machines. The performance of SVR was found to be better than ANFIS for the data sets used.

abstract = {Variable speed machinery presents a particular challenge to automated condition-monitoring systems; changes in speed have a strong relation to the vibration response collected by accelerometers-the effect of which may mask fault conditions in standard condition monitoring techniques. In order to account for the effects of this measurable variable, the vibration response will be segmented into speed bins with a small range of speed. The mean and covariance matrix for the feature vectors in each speed bin will be computed in order to derive a statistical novelty boundary for that bin. Each component of these statistical parameters can then be interpolated or regressed in order to derive boundaries for speed segments where no training data is available. A comparison of the use of a statistical decision boundary and support vector boundaries, whose inputs have been centralized and whitened with these statistical parameters, will reveal a stronger classification approach. These methods were validated on data gathered from an experimental gearbox and motor apparatus operating at variable speeds; the results indicate a high degree of separability between data from healthy and faulted states-providing exceptional classification error. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper introduces the Bayesian regularization applied to the Force Analysis Technique (FAT), a method for identifying vibration sources from displacement measurements. The FAT is based on the equation of motion of a structure instead of a transfer matrix as it is the case for most of inverse problems. This particularity allows the estimation of vibration sources without the need of boundary conditions. Nevertheless, this method is highly sensitive to noise perturbations and needs a careful regularization. Two Bayesian approaches are thus presented. Firstly, the empirical Bayesian regularization which shows better robustness than L-curve and GCV regularizations while keeping a low numerical cost. Secondly, a fully Bayesian procedure using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm which provides credible intervals on variables of interest besides the automatically regularized vibration source field. In particular, measurement quality can be evaluated by the noise variance estimation and the uncertainties over the source level are quantified for a wide frequency range, with only a unique measurement scan.},

abstract = {Conventional vibration monitoring techniques are unable to provide accurate state analysis of a gearbox under varying load condition. This paper proposes a novel technique for state detection of gearbox, which fits a time-varying autoregressive model to the gear motion residual signals applying a noise-adaptive Kalman filter, in the healthy state of the target gear. The optimum autoregressive model order, which provides a compromised model fitting for the healthy gear motion residual signals collected under various load conditions, is determined with the aid of a specific model order selection method proposed in this study. Consequently, a robust statistical measure, which takes the percentage of outliers exceeding the three standard deviation limits is applied to evaluate the state of the target gear, where the standard deviation of autoregressive model residuals takes its maximum in all tested gear motion residual signals for model order selection. The proposed technique is validated using full lifetime vibration data of gearboxes operating from new to failure under four distinct load conditions. The investigated load conditions include: (1) constant load, (2) one jump from 100 to 200{\%} nominal torque level, (3) one jump from 100 to 300{\%} nominal torque level, and (4) constant changed to sinusoidal. In each application, the specific model order selection and comparison of the proposed gear state indicator with three counterparts proposed in recent studies are addressed in detail. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is also performed as a complementary statistical analysis. The results show that the proposed technique possesses a highly effective and robust property in the state detection of gearbox, which is independent of varying load condition as well as remarkable stability, early alarm for incipient fault and significant presence of fault effects. The proposed gear state indicator can be directly employed by an on-line maintenance program as a reliable quantitative covariate to schedule optimal maintenance decision for rotating machinery. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Including forecasting activities in the maintenance cycle achieved the dual goal of identifying any need for measures ahead of the deadlines established for routine preventive maintenance in the event of alarm conditions being detected, and of postponing any scheduled measures in the event of the components in question still being in good condition. Soft computing tools were experimentally used to achieve these objectives. Recurrent neural nets and neuro-fuzzy systems were used to ensure that the assessment of the trends of the global values was effective in determining the time remaining before the next outage period was needed. Using these tools enabled an accurate prediction of the values of the vibrations on rotating machinery based on the values of the operating parameters given as input. The plan was part of a maintenance management scheme seen as a container of inspection activities providing the foundations for systematically organizing certain servicing measures (e.g. the replacement of bearings, or alignments on rotating machinery, etc.), and to prevent sudden breakdown situations. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In modern rotating machinery, rotary encoders have been widely used for the purpose of positioning and dynamic control. The study in this paper indicates that, the encoder signal, after proper processing, can be also effectively used for the health monitoring of rotating machines. In this work, a Kurtosis-guided local polynomial differentiator (KLPD) is proposed to estimate the instantaneous angular speed (IAS) of rotating machines based on the encoder signal. Compared with the central difference method, the KLPD is more robust to noise and it is able to precisely capture the weak speed jitters introduced by mechanical defects. The fault diagnosis of planetary gearbox has proven to be a challenging issue in both industry and academia. Based on the proposed KLPD, a systematic method for the fault diagnosis of planetary gearbox is proposed. In this method, residual time synchronous time averaging (RTSA) is first employed to remove the operation-related IAS components that come from normal gear meshing and non-stationary load variations, KLPD is then utilized to detect and enhance the speed jitter from the IAS residual in a data-driven manner. The effectiveness of proposed method has been validated by both simulated data and experimental data. The results demonstrate that the proposed KLPD-RTSA could not only detect fault signatures but also identify defective components, thus providing a promising tool for the health monitoring of planetary gearbox.},

abstract = {The measurement of instantaneous angular speed is being increasingly investigated for its use in a wide range of condition monitoring and prognostic applications. Central to many measurement techniques are incremental shaft encoders recording the arrival times of shaft angular increments. The conventional approach to processing these signals assumes that the angular increments are equidistant. This assumption is generally incorrect when working with toothed wheels and especially zebra tape encoders and has been shown to introduce errors in the estimated shaft speed. There are some proposed methods in the literature that aim to compensate for this geometric irregularity. Some of the methods require the shaft speed to be perfectly constant for calibration, something rarely achieved in practice. Other methods assume the shaft speed to be nearly constant with minor deviations. Therefore existing methods cannot calibrate the entire shaft encoder geometry for arbitrary shaft speeds. The present article presents a method to calculate the shaft encoder geometry for arbitrary shaft speed profiles. The method uses Bayesian linear regression to calculate the encoder increment distances. The method is derived and then tested against simulated and laboratory experiments. The results indicate that the proposed method is capable of accurately determining the shaft encoder geometry for any shaft speed profile.},

Since the geometry and manufacturing procedures of large rolling slewing bearings are considerably different from those of standard rolling bearings, different calculation procedures have to be used. The paper describes a computational procedure, where the geometry of the bearing is described with vectors, which enables modelling of irregular shapes of the bearing rings. These can be a result of the manufacturing procedure or of the deformations caused by the operating conditions. The calculation procedure consists of calculation of the maximum contact force on the rolling element, which is done by the in-house developed program, and detailed finite element analysis of the contact between the ball and the raceway. The finite element analysis also takes into account depth-dependent material parameters of a raceway. Different calculation theories are then used for the calculation of fatigue life, and a comparison of the results is made at the end. {\textcopyright} 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper the application of embedding space and fractal dimension estimation to monitor the condition of a system with clearance is considered by examining the effect on the correlation dimension of variations of the gap clearance in a bearing system. The model analysed represents an elastically supported rotor and stator, subject to excitation by an imbalance, which is restricted to two-dimensional linear movement perpendicular to the axis of rotation. From full-phase space calculations it is found that as the clearance between the rotor and stator is increased, there is a discernible decrease in the value of the correlation dimension. Thus, it may be feasible to determine changing events such as gap clearance by monitoring the correlation dimension of the system.

abstract = {Our new compound diagnostic system comprised of a compound sensor, a signal processor, and a personal computer installed signal processing software. The compound sensor made by an advanced sensor fusion technique was able to detect simultaneously the vibration acceleration and the acoustic emission by itself. The signal processor received a signal from the sensor and separated it into the vibration acceleration signal and the acoustic emission signal. The signal processor and the personal computer processed the acceleration signal and acoustic emission signal for diagnostic information. The rolling contact fatigue process of a ball bearing under grease lubrication was monitored using the compound system. The system outputs diagnostic information, for example, the means, the variance, the skewness, and the kurtosis of the vibration acceleration signal and the acoustic emission signal. In diagnosing the rolling contact fatigue failure, the root mean square (rms) value of the vibration acceleration was most effective, and the mean of the demodulated acoustic emission was second to the rms value of the acceleration in effectiveness. From the result of the evaluation, it became clear that the system was useful for diagnosing rolling contact bearings under grease lubrication.},

abstract = {This work describes the architecture for developing physics of failure models, derived as a function of machine sensor data, and integrating with data pertaining to other relevant factors like geography, manufacturing, environment, customer and inspection information, that are not easily modeled using physics principles. The mechanics of the system is characterized using surrogate models for stress and metal temperature based on results from multiple non-linear finite element simulations. A cumulative damage index measure has been formulated that quantifies the health of the component. To address deficiencies in the simulation results, a model tuning framework is designed to improve the accuracy of the model. Despite the model tuning, un-modelled sources of variation can lead to insufficient model accuracy. It is required to incorporate these un-modelled effects so as to improve the model performance. A novel machine learning based model fusion approach has been presented that can combine physics model predictions with other data sources that are difficult to incorporate in a physics framework. This approach has been applied to a gas turbine hot section turbine blade failure prediction example.},

abstract = {An envelope order tracking analysis scheme is proposed in the paper for the fault detection of rolling element bearing (REB) under varying-speed running condition. The developed method takes the advantages of order tracking, envelope analysis and spectral kurtosis. The fast kurtogram algorithm is utilized to obtain both optimal center frequency and bandwidth of the band-pass filter based on the maximum spectral kurtosis. The envelope containing vibration features of the incipient REB fault can be extracted adaptively. The envelope is re-sampled by the even-angle sampling scheme, and thus the non-stationary signal in the time domain is represented as a quasi-stationary signal in the angular domain. As a result, the frequency-smear problem can be eliminated in order spectrum and the fault diagnosis of REB in the varying-speed running condition of the rotating machinery is achieved. Experiments are conducted to verify the validity of the proposed method. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Various approaches for prognostics have been developed, and data-driven methods are increasingly applied. The training step of these methods generally requires huge datasets to build a model of the degradation signal, and estimate the limit under which the degradation signal should stay. Applicability and accuracy of these methods are thereby closely related to the amount of available data, and even sometimes requires the user to make assumptions on the dynamics of health states evolution. Following that, the aim of this paper is to propose a method for prognostics and remaining useful life estimation that starts from scratch, without any prior knowledge. Assuming that remaining useful life can be seen as the time between the current time and the instant where the degradation is above an acceptable limit, the proposition is based on a classification of prediction strategy (CPS) that relies on two factors. First, it relies on the use of an evolving real-time neuro-fuzzy system that forecasts observations in time. Secondly, it relies on the use of an evidential Markovian classifier based on Dempster-Shafer theory that enables classifying observations into the possible functioning modes. This approach has the advantage to cope with a lack of data using an evolving system, and theory of belief functions. Also, one of the main assets is the possibility to train the prognostic system without setting any threshold. The whole proposition is illustrated and assessed by using the CMAPPS turbofan dataset. RUL estimates are shown to be very close to actual values, and the approach appears to accurately estimate the failure instants, even with few learning data. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {The sensitivity of various features that are characteristics of machine performance may vary significantly under different working conditions. Thus it is critical to devise a systematic feature extraction (FE) approach that provides a useful and automatic guidance on using the most effective features for machine performance prediction without human intervention. This paper proposes a locality preserving projections (LPP)-based FE approach. Different from principal component analysis (PCA) that aims to discover the global structure of the Euclidean space, LPP is capable to discover local structure of the data manifold. This may enable LPP to find more meaningful low-dimensional information hidden in the high-dimensional observations compared with PCA. The effectiveness of the proposed approach for bearing defect and severity classification is evaluated experimentally on bearing test-beds. Furthermore, a novel health assessment indication, Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based negative log likelihood probability (NLLP) is developed to provide a comprehensible indication for quantifying bearing performance degradation. The proposed approach has shown to provide better performance than using regular features (e.g., root mean square (RMS)). The experimental results indicate potential applications of LPP-based FE and GMM as effective tools for bearing performance degradation assessment. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Rolling-element bearings are among the most used elements in industrial machinery thus an early detection of a defect in these components is necessary to avoid major machine failures. Vibration analysis is a widely used condition monitoring technique for high-speed rotating machinery. Using the information contained in the vibration signals an automatic method for bearing fault detection and diagnosis is presented in this work. Initially a one-class m-SVM is used to discriminate between normal and faulty conditions. In order to build a model of normal operation regime only data extracted under normal conditions is used. Band-pass filters and Hilbert Transform are then used sequentially to obtain the envelope spectrum of the original raw signal that will finally be used to identify the location of the problem. In order to check the performance of the method two different data sets are used: (a) real data from a laboratory test-to-failure experiment and (b) data obtained from a fault-seeded bearing test. The results showed that the method was able not only to detect the failure in an incipient stage but also to identify the location of the defect and qualitatively assess its evolution over time. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The angular accelerometer is a versatile inertial instrument with applications ranging from stabilization to navigation and satellite pointing. The performance state-of-the-art in angular accelerometry is set by the large fluid-rotor concept with low bandwidth while Micro-Electromechanical System (MEMS) angular accelerometers offer a compact lower accuracy option. A novel angular accelerometer is proposed by the author to improve on contemporary angular accelerometers and MEMS gyroscopes. The sensor consists of spiral channels micromachined into multiple wafers to construct a spiral helix fluid column with high angular pressure generating potential. The two ends of the fluid column are joined at a central measurement chamber where a diaphragm-based pressure transducer outputs a signal proportional to the applied angular acceleration. The objective of this research is to derive and synthesize the theory necessary for simulation of the sensor and thereafter investigate the potential of the sensor. A wave speed corrected discrete multi degree of freedom model simulates pressure generation and -propagation. The pressure theory is verified by means of a 200mm diameter spool using 3mm polyurethane tubing with diesel or water as the inertial fluid. Accelerations of up to 480rad/s2 are imposed on 1.5m and 20m tube lengths using a rate table and the generated pressure sampled at 2kHz. Channel flow is simulated by means of a model directly derived from Szymanski's unsteady laminar flow theory, while the pressure transducer diaphragm model is based on linear flat plate theory. Two pressure transducers are studied, the strain-gaged plain circular diaphragm and a piezo-based transducer with an annular diaphragm. All sensor theory is synthesized into a linear sensor model and the dynamic response optimized by means of the Kuhn-Tucker method. The application of the optimization routine is somewhat restricted by the presence of multiple minima in the sensor's cost function and selection of various starting conditions points out available envelopes of sensor design. Designer judgment is applied within these local envelopes to achieve the desired sensor performance. When referenced against a noise level of 1$\mu$V/ Hz, a sensor with resolution of 6 $\mu$rad / s{\^{}}2 and bandwidth of 50Hz is simulated as feasible in a sensor of 22mm diameter by 22mm height.},

Many different techniques are available to process experimental signals, among others: FFT, wavelet transform, cepstrum, demodulation analysis, second order ciclostationarity analysis, etc. However, often hypothesis about data and computational efforts restrict the application of some techniques. In order to overcome these limitations, the empirical mode decomposition has been proposed. The outputs of this adaptive approach are the intrinsic mode functions that are treated with the Hilbert transform in order to obtain the HilbertHuang spectrum. Anyhow, the selection of the intrinsic mode functions used for the calculation of HilbertHuang spectrum is normally done on the basis of user's experience. On the contrary, in the paper a merit index is introduced that allows the automatic selection of the intrinsic mode functions that should be used. The effectiveness of the improvement is proven by the result of the experimental tests presented and performed on a test-rig equipped with a spiral bevel gearbox, whose high contact ratio made difficult to diagnose also serious damages of the gears. This kind of gearbox is normally never employed for benchmarking diagnostics techniques. By using the merit index, the defective gearbox is always univocally identified, also considering transient operating conditions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Railway vehicles are generally maintained preventively within certain time periods. Condition based predictive maintenance strategies have a great economic potential so that modern trains are equipped with many sensors in order to perform diagnostics and prognostics of components. Methods for fault detection need appropriate feature subsets in order to achieve small in-sample and out-sample errors. In our case the typical feature selection approach using pure data-driven methods is difficult, as the number of possible feature sets is very large. On the other hand there exists rich domain knowledge and detailed physical models of the mechanical system. The aim is to combine this knowledge with the often used mathematical methods for feature selection for improving classification of cases when a faulty damper is present. Based on the dynamic equations of motion, this paper presents heuristic feature selection via the analysis of transfer functions. We describe several well- known methods of automated feature selection and a workflow which combines domain knowledge with automated methods. Results show that it is difficult to define features based only on domain-knowledge, but in combination with data-driven techniques good classification performance can be achieved.},

abstract = {This research focuses on the development of an intelligent diagnostic system for rotating machinery. The system is composed of a signal processing module and a state inference module. In the signal processing module, the recursive least square (RLS) algorithm and the Kalman filter are exploited to extract the order amplitudes of vibration signals, followed by fault classification using the fuzzy state inference module. The RLS algorithm and Kalman filter provide advantages in order tracking over conventional Fourier-based techniques in that they are insensitive to smearing problems arising from closely spaced orders or crossing orders. On the basis of thus obtained order features, the potential fault types are then deduced with the aid of a state inference engine. Human diagnostic rules are fuzzified for various common faults, including the single fault and double fault situations. This system is implemented on the platform of a floating point digital signal processor, where a photo switch and an accelerometer supply the shaft speed and acceleration signals, respectively. Experiments were carried out for a rotor kit and a practical four-cylinder engine to show the effectiveness of the proposed system in tracking the rotating order with precise inference. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In condition monitoring (CM) of mechanical drives, the analysis of various physical and chemical properties of the operating lubricant can be used to diagnose defects and assess the state of the system. Recent developments in on-line oil condition sensors and advances in signal processing methods have allowed for a system for on-line oil analysis to be developed and applied in the field of predictive maintenance. The System for On-line Oil Analysis (SOOA) has the ability to measure multiple oil properties of interest and detect faults induced by transients in the acquired signals. Transient detection is based on the cumulative sum of errors (CUSUM) technique, where the error represents the difference between the predicted reference value and the current measured value. Detection of abnormal behaviour, based on transient detection, is followed by fault diagnosis, through integrated assessment of oil properties in real time. The system can operate as a standalone unit with an independent user interface or as a part of a complete integrated diagnostic system, merging oil condition evaluation with vibrational analysis and other techniques. This paper focuses on the algorithms within SOOA in charge of transient detection and fault diagnosis. The results of SOOA operation are presented through a demonstration of the method in a laboratory environment with two different sets of tests: gear pitting and water contamination.},

abstract = {Commercial tools for measurement and analysis of noise and vibration signals have traditionally been very expensive. In the last decade, however, multi-channel measurement systems have become relatively inexpensive. The analysis functionality in most inexpensive instruments is limited. Therefore, many companies are using alternatives for post processing of measurement results. MATLAB is a platform that is popular for this purpose and which offers many advantages over dedicated, menu driven systems. The open functions in MATLAB assure flexibility and the possibility to modify functions for specific needs. In addition, a command based programming environment provides for traceability and quality assurance, including qualification of used algorithms, important aspects particularly in the aerospace industry. In the past, basic functions for physically scaled signal analysis and vibration analysis have had to be developed before taking full advantage of the MATLAB platform. In this paper we present a new suite of toolboxes, developed by Axiom EduTech, that turn MATLAB into bleeding edge software for noise and vibration analysis. The toolboxes presented here have been well proven in applications in automotive and aerospace industry. Parts of the toolboxes are provided as freeware, and everyone is encouraged to download this from Internet.},

abstract = {Rolling element bearings are one of the most essential yet vulnerable components in railway systems. Due to harsh working conditions, its health condition degrades over time, or worse still, the incipient fault signature is easily overshadowed by strong interfering noise. In recent years, sparse representations of the vibration signal have attracted more and more attention in the scientific community. The benefits of sparsity-based models have been fruitfully explored and, in brief, most of the research matches the fault signature of vibration signal to some degree which addresses specified problems rather than general ones. The state-of-the-art in sparsity, as it applied to machinery fault diagnosis, still faced some challenges. Of particular importance is dealing with the incipient fault, especially in the case of poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The aim of this communication is to fill in the gaps by introducing the low-rank and sparse model (LRSM). First, recent sparsity-based models are succinctly reviewed with their pros and cons. Second, a new model based on the low-rank and sparse constrains is proposed for capturing the repetitive transients embedded in heavy background noise which jeopardize their symptoms in practical applications. Eventually, its effectiveness is investigated on synthetic signals in the case of low SNR=-6dB.},

Technology based on torsional vibration is under development for condition-based assessment of shaft health. The focus of this paper is on the relationship between a crack, which propagated due to bending loads, and the torsional stiffness of the shaft. An analytical method to determine the compliance associated with a crack has been implemented for a semi-elliptical surface crack. A 3-D finite element model of a shaft section with a crack has also been used to predict the effect of a crack on stiffness. Fatigue cracks were seeded in shafts on a three-point bend apparatus. A benchtop test rig was constructed to evaluate the torsional natural frequencies of a cracked shaft system. Quasistatic torsional stiffness tests indicated that crack closure has an effect on the results. A torsional finite element model of the benchtop test rig indicates that the first torsional natural frequency is reduced by the propagation of a crack. The reduction in torsional stiffness of the shaft inferred from the natural frequency results is in reasonable agreement with the quasistatic results and the model predictions.},

The emitted signal comprises an interaction between (i) time-dependent components related to the system dynamics (e.g. transfer function) and (ii) angle-dependent mechanisms related to the system kinematics (e.g. impact, load modulations...). This necessarily implies the inadequacy of classical cyclostationary tools no matter a temporal or angular vision is adopted. This consequently calls for an angle$\backslash$time approach which preserves - via the angle variable - the cyclic evolution of the signal while maintaining - via the time variable - a temporal description of the system dynamics. The first object of this paper is to analytically characterize bearing fault vibrations and explore its angle$\backslash$time cyclostationary property. The second object is to experimentally validate these results on real-world vibration signals and demonstrate the optimality of the angle-time approach over classical approaches for rolling element bearing diagnosis.},

abstract = {Accurate health prognosis is critical for ensuring equipment reliability and reducing the overall life-cycle costs. The existing gear prognosis methods are primarily either model-based or data-driven. In this paper, an integrated prognostics method is developed for gear remaining life prediction, which utilizes both gear physical models and real-time condition monitoring data. The general prognosis framework for gears is proposed. The developed physical models include a gear finite element model for gear stress analysis, a gear dynamics model for dynamic load calculation, and a damage propagation model described using Paris' law. A gear mesh stiffness computation method is developed based on the gear system potential energy, which results in more realistic curved crack propagation paths. Material uncertainty and model uncertainty are considered to account for the differences among different specific units that affect the damage propagation path.

Traditionally a transducer is attached to the structure under investigation and the vibration signal recorded. This signal is then processed and the required information extracted from the signal. With epicyclic gearboxes this traditional approach is not advisable. This is in part due to the fact that the planet gears rotate internally on a planet carrier. Special techniques are therefore required to extract a viable data signal from the measured vibration signal. These techniques require an additional post-processing step in which a compiled data signal is extracted from the measured data signal.},

In this paper, a 2-D finite element method with principle of linear elastic fracture mechanics is adopted to carry out crack propagation path studies for gear pair with different contact ratio. The work is driven by the need to improve the accuracy of computing the gear mesh stiffness which plays a major role in gear fault diagnosis. A refined total potential energy model, as reported in literature is adopted and extended to compute the total time varying mesh stiffness with increasing level of deterioration and different contact ratio. A comparative study has been carried out to reflect the change in the total effective gear mesh stiffness caused by assumed straight line vs. proposed curved crack path approximation for varying crack levels. The computational method proposed here can predict the change of gear mesh stiffness for different crack propagation paths to provide some guidance for gear damage detection. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Condition monitoring of epicyclic gearboxes through vibration signature analysis, with particular focus on time domain methods and the use of adaptive filtering techniques for the purpose of signal enhancement, is the central theme of this work. Time domain filtering methods for the purpose of removal of random noise components from periodic, but not necessarily stationary or cyclostationary, signals are developed. Damage identification is accomplished through vibration signature analysis by nonstationary timefrequency methods, belonging to Cohen�s general class of time-frequency distributions, strictly based in the time domain. Although a powerful and commonly used noise reduction technique, synchronous averaging requires alternate sensors in addition to the vibration pickup. For this reason the use of time domain techniques that employ only the vibration data is investigated. Adaptive filters may be used to remove random noise from the nonstationary signals considered. The well-known Least Mean Squares algorithm is employed in an adaptive line enhancer configuration. To counter the much discussed convergence difficulties that are often experienced when the least mean squares algorithm is applied, a new unconditionally convergent algorithm based on the spherical quadratic steepest descent method is presented. The spherical quadratic steepest descent method has been shown to be unconditionally convergent when applied to a quadratic objective function. Time-frequency methods are succinctly employed to analyse the vibration signals simultaneously in the time and frequency domains. Transients covering a wide frequency range are a clear and definite indication of impacting events as gear teeth mate, and observation of such events on a timefrequency distribution are used to indicate damage to the transmission. The pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution and the Spectrogram, both belonging to Cohen�s general class of time-frequency distributions are comparatively used to the end of damage identification. It is shown that an unconditionally convergent adaptive filtering technique used in conjunction with time-frequency methods can indicate a damaged condition in an epicyclic gearbox, where the non-adaptively filtered data did not present clear indications of damage.},

abstract = {When a tooth crack failure occurs, the vibration response characteristics caused by the change of time-varying mesh stiffness play an important role in crack fault diagnosis. In this paper, an improved time-varying mesh stiffness algorithm is presented. A coupled lateral and torsional vibration dynamic model is used to simulate the vibration response of gear-rotor system with tooth crack. The effects of geometric transmission error (GTE), bearing stiffness, and gear mesh stiffness on the dynamic model are analyzed. The simulation results show that the gear dynamic response is periodic impulses due to the periodic sudden change of time varying mesh stiffness. When the cracked tooth comes in contact, the impulse amplitude will increase as a result of reductions of mesh stiffness. Amplitude modulation phenomenon caused by GTE can be found in the simulation signal. The lateral-torsional coupling frequency increases greatly within certain limits and thereafter reaches a constant while the lateral natural frequency nearly remains constant as the gear mesh stiffness increases. Finally, an experiment was conducted on a test bench with 2. mm root crack fault. The results of experiment agree well with those obtained by simulation. The proposed method improves the accuracy of using potential energy method to calculate the time-varying mesh stiffness and expounds the vibration mechanism of gear-rotor system with tooth crack failure. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Within the context of particle filters, this paper introduces several novel methods for uncertainty representations and uncertainty management. The prediction uncertainty is modeled via a rescaled Epanechnikov kernel and is assisted with resampling techniques and regularization algorithms. Uncertainty management is accomplished through parametric adjustments in a feedback correction loop of the state model and its noise distributions. The correction loop provides the mechanism to incorporate information that can improve solution accuracy and reduce uncertainty bounds. In addition, this approach results in reduction in computational burden.

abstract = {Structural health monitoring provides sensor data that can monitor fatigue-induced damage in service. This information may in turn be used to improve the characterization of material properties that govern damage growth for the structure being monitored. These properties are often widely distributed among nominally identical materials because of differences in manufacturing processes and due to aging effects. Improved accuracy in damage growth characteristics would allow more accurate prediction of the remaining useful life ofthe structural component. In this paper, a probabilistic approach using Bayesian inference is employed to progressively reduce the uncertainty in structure-specific damage growth parameters in spite of noise and bias in sensor measurements. Starting from an initial wide distribution of damage growth parameters that are obtained from coupon tests, the distribution is progressively narrowed using damage growth data between consecutive measurements. Detailed discussions on how to construct the likelihood function under the given noise of sensor data and how to update the distribution are presented. The approach is applied to simulated damage growth in fuselage panels due to cycles of pressurization. It is shown that the proposed method rapidly converges to the accurate damage growth parameters when the initial damage size is relatively large: e.g., 20 mm. Fairly accurate damage growth parameters are obtained even with measurement errors of 5 mm. Using the identified damage growth parameters, it is shown that the 95{\%} conservative remaining useful life converges to the true remaining useful life from the conservative side. The proposed approach may have the potential of turning aircraft into flying fatigue laboratories. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010.},

Finite element are the most popular method and is used as a bechmark to verify the correctness of other methods

Analytical methods is less computationally expensive than finite element methods and provide satisfying results. A commponly used analytical method is based on the potential energy approach where the gear tooth is approximated as a non-uniform cantilever beam. 

Finally a approximation using the ISO standard is also possible. It has the advantage of being simple and giving a simple order of magnitude estimation of the GMS. 

Finds that the stiffness in single tooth contact region is very similar between methods but there are significant discrepancies in the double contact region. 

The traditional Analytical method an the ISO approximation method overestimates the mesh stiffness of multiple tooth pair contact

The Improved analytical method gives results that are relatively consistent with the FE methods. 

Differnece between calculation results of 2D and 3D Fem are within 10{\%} proving that the 2D simplification makes sense

The second part summarizes the TVMS calculation methods including analytical methods, FE methods, combined analytical-FE approaches and experimental methods. The final part reviews the dynamic models for vibration analysis of cracked gear systems including lumped mass models and FE models, where the crack effects are characterized by introducing TVMS of cracked gear pairs into the system dynamic models.
